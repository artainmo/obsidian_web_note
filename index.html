      <p>Amazon Kendra could be used to find relevant responses to natural language questions in repositories of text. <br />
A repository of text could be created by collecting 'codes juridique', 'ouvrages', 'arrêts'. This would form a first service as collecting all those resources is not easy. The second service would use Amazon Kendra to use NLP for finding relevant text parts in all those resources for a law problem described in natural language.   </p>
<p>Before creating this startup maybe wait until 'les arrêts' become public as this is an important data source that will probably become public in the future but not yet. As now it can be partly accessed but is complicated.   </p>
<p>The question is if lawyers prefer to use a service that finds relevant information within official documentation (such as 'codes juridique', 'ouvrages', 'arrêts', or previous consultations), or if they prefer to use a LLM that can answer questions directly without referencing official documentation? The former would use Amazon Kendra while the latter would use fine tuning on an LLM such as Amazon Titan. Alternatively, a combination of both could answer questions directly but all the while referencing its answers. Maybe, proposing references for the lawyer to have a direct interaction with the official documentation and form his own conclusions, makes the most sense.   </p>
<p>Technological wise, maybe get inspiration from this: <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">LLM, obsidian, personal-project, startup-idea</a>.   </p>
<p>Maybe, the LLM could be trained on the notes of all lawyers. If it finds an answer on another lawyer's note, this note may be open-source or have a paywall. If it has a paywall the associated lawyer can have reputation points.   </p>

This looks like what I want to do. I should talk to Maximillien about it.</p></div>
