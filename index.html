I will have to pay social security for this quarter, and should start a job tomorrow if I want to not pay the next quarter.   </p>
<p>Ask Xerius if I can pause my enterprise to stop paying social security as I don't have active revenue either way, meaning I can easily reactivate my enterprise later on when revenue will arrive. <br />
