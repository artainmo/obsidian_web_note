"Tooth autotransplantation is the treatment modality in which a tooth is transferred from one site to another in the same person. This technique has a history of centuries. However, it is not well-known or well-documented." <br />
"There is evidence that tooth autotransplantation is an effective method of restoring missing teeth, particularly for growing children. Even if autotransplantation fails, the soft tissue and bone conditions would likely still be suitable for subsequent implant treatment." <br />
"The findings from the available literature suggest that tooth autotransplantation is a viable and cost-effective technique." <br />
"Providing the proper parameters are met and highly experienced surgeons are consulted, it may be possible to achieve significant cost-effective benefits with autotransplantation of teeth in growing patients. Through the application of conical beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and enhanced speed of three-dimensional (3D) image modeling, this procedure is expected to have higher success rates and greater longevity, as the template produced is highly accurate and the donor's tooth is exposed for less time outside the mouth. There is nothing new about tooth autotransplantation. Through future technological advancement and improved clinician awareness, autotransplantation might become a more widely available option and have a much better chance of becoming a realistic treatment option for adolescents." <br />
"It is also possible that autotransplanted teeth show widely varying success and survival rates among different studies. When osseointegrated single-tooth implants were compared with autotransplanted teeth, the survival rates were comparable <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9678114/#REF33" class="external-link">33</a>. Over five years, Czochrowska et al. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9678114/#REF34" class="external-link">34</a> followed up 100 autotransplanted teeth with a 90% survival rate and five single-tooth implants with a 94.5% survival rate." <br />
"As adjacent teeth do not need to be prepared, this is a more desirable option than traditional prosthetics. It is also more cost-effective" <br />
"A tooth with an incompletely formed root with an incomplete apex (an apex greater than 1 mm across) would be much more favorable <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9678114/#REF27" class="external-link">27</a>. However, autotransplantation of mature teeth with complete root formation can be a predictable treatment and is not necessarily associated with poor prognosis"   </p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/edt.12819" class="external-link">A step-by step guide for autotransplantation of teeth</a> <br />
"Although several treatment options exist to treat a missing or hopeless tooth, especially in young individuals, most of the existing alternatives (such as orthodontic treatment, removable or fixed partial dentures, and dental implants) impose a challenge in children due to the nature of the developing jaw bones. Tooth autotransplantation is the replacement of a tooth with another functional tooth within the patient's dentition. Autotransplantation can serve as a promising treatment alternative in cases of tooth loss not only in children and adolescents but also in adult patients." <br />
"Autotransplantation is a technique-sensitive procedure, that requires proper and thorough planning as well as careful and knowledgeable execution in order to improve the chances for long-term success and survival of the transplanted tooth. Thus, the aim of this article was to provide a step-by-step clinical guide, emphasizing key points and highlights for planning and performing a successful autotransplantation procedure. Autotransplantation is a very predictable treatment modality that can serve as a viable option to replace a missing tooth, especially in young patients. Proper planning and careful execution of the procedure are important to achieve optimal long-term results." <br />
"Very high success and survival rates were reported with the use of autotransplantations in various patient populations" <br />
"The ability of transplanted teeth to remain harmonious with the adjacent teeth allows for natural space closure, higher esthetics, and reduced cost and treatment time in comparison to dental implants" <br />
"This will also enable soft and hard tissue preservation and further development. Even if the tooth has been missing for a long time and bone loss has occurred, bone regeneration was observed in the recipient socket, as well as presence of lamina dura in the transplant site" <br />
"Most patients were satisfied with the esthetic outcome of their transplanted teeth" <br />
"Autotransplanted teeth allow preservation of the alveolar bone in the area of the missing tooth (compared to an empty extraction site), which can be used for a future implant in case of a failure" <br />
"It is important to realize, though, that autotransplantation is a technique-sensitive procedure, that requires proper and thorough planning as well as careful and knowledgeable execution in order to improve the chances for long-term success and survival of the transplanted tooth. Thus, the aim of this article was to provide a step-by-step clinical guide, emphasizing key points, and highlights for planning and performing a successful autotransplantation procedure." <br />
"In order for autotransplantation to be successful, it is first necessary to have clear criteria for judging whether autotransplantation is indicated. The following points can be used as indication criteria for conventional autotransplantation:   </p>
<ul>
<li>There are hopeless or missing teeth and available, suitable and spare-able donor teeth such as premolars or third molars in the same mouth   </li>
<li>It is preferable that the donor tooth has a simple, easy-to-extract form (single root, conical, bullet-shaped, etc.), and that the bone width of the recipient site is wide enough to accommodate the donor tooth.   </li>
<li>If the donor tooth is completely developed, it is preferable that the patient is no older than 30 years of age.   </li>
<li>Autotransplantation should have more advantages than other treatments (implants, bridges, removable dentures, etc.). Criteria of advantages include treatment duration, cost, aesthetics, preservability, and biological acceptability."   </li>
</ul>
<p>"A transplantation of a third mandibular molar to a hopeless first mandibular molar site. (A) A panoramic view of a 20 -yearold female, who was referred for the treatment of the right first mandibular molar. A vertical fracture on the mesial aspect of the mesial root was suspected. (B) A periapical radiograph of the right first molar. The lamina dura is unclear on the mesial aspect. (C) An occlusal view of the right first molar. (D) A sagittal view of a CBCT of the right third molar (the donor tooth) and the right first molar (recipient site). The prognosis of the right first molar seems poor. The impacted third molar seems to be a good candidate as a donor to replace the right first molar. The stage of root development is stage 6 and a little late for optimal stages as a donor tooth but still pulp healing might be expected." <br />
"the first step of the surgery is a tooth extraction of the recipient site after anesthesia" <br />
"(P) Incision over the donor tooth. (Q) Revealing the crown of the donor tooth. (R) Removing the bone over the crown with piezotome. (S) Incision into the sulcus around the donor tooth. (T) Extraction of the donor tooth." <br />
"The donor tooth is placed into the socket after suturing the mesial flap with one knot. (Y) Cross-suture over the occlusal surface of the transplant is performed to fix the transplanted tooth for 1 week. (Z) Suturing the donor site." <br />
"If the tooth mobility is increased after removing the suture, the transplant is splinted to the adjacent tooth with wire and bonding resin for 1 month." <br />
"Three months postop. In transplantation of an immature tooth, the healing should be followed up every month for the first 3 months because inflammatory resorption may take place if the pulp is infected. Once inflammatory resorption is found, pulp canal treatment should be started. This case seems to have no complication" <br />
"In transplantation of mature teeth, it is necessary to perform root canal treatment (RCT) of the transplanted tooth. In addition, root canal treatment is necessary even for immature teeth if pulp healing does not occur after transplantation." <br />
"When donor teeth are mature, RCT may be completed before transplantation or performed after transplantation. For impacted teeth, RCT must be performed after transplantation and can be started 2 weeks after transplantation and is limited to removal of the coronal pulp (due to the high degree of tooth mobility, a rubber dam cannot be performed). Four weeks after the transplantation, RCT is finalized to the apex. If the apical foramen is open, calcium hydroxide is applied for several months (about 6 months) until the apical foramen is closed with hard tissue. Then, the final root canal filling with sealer and gutta-percha or MTA is performed."   </p>

<p>Autotransplantation offers various advantages on treatment duration, cost, higher esthetics, bone regeneration. Even if it fails, the bone would still be suitable for a subsequent implant treatment.   </p>

<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/edt.12495" class="external-link">Long‐term outcomes of autotransplantation of teeth: A case series</a> <br />
"During the course of private practice, 2 separate analyses were performed on a total of 319 cases with follow‐up ranging from 2 to 26 years. The results showed a tendency toward higher success rates in younger patients; the success rate was highest in ATTs performed on immature teeth (about 95%), about 90% in patients younger than 30 years of age and approximately 80% in patients older than 30." <br />
"A 45‐year‐old woman suffered a crown‐root fracture of the maxillary left first molar (Figure 4A). The tooth was extracted, and the impacted maxillary left third molar was transplanted 3 weeks later (Figure 4B and 4). Because of the pneumatization of the sinus floor, sinus elevation via a crestal approach was performed simultaneously with ATT (Figure 4D). Because the donor tooth had complete root formation, root canal treatment (RCT) was necessary. The RCT was initiated 2 weeks after the surgery, and after instrumentation and cleaning of the canal space, calcium hydroxide was placed." <br />
"A mandibular left first molar of a 39‐year‐old patient had a very poor prognosis and was replaced with the mandibular third molar (Figure 6A and 6). Because the donor tooth had complete root formation, the RCT was initiated 2 weeks after the surgery," <br />
"The surgical treatment aspects of transplantation are more technique sensitive compared with most implant cases. However, the postsurgical restorations are most often simpler for transplants than those of implants. In the case of osseointegrated implants, they do not erupt nor move along with adjacent teeth, especially in younger patients, and this can lead to infraocclusion with functional and esthetic problems. On the other hand, transplanted teeth can erupt and move in harmony with the adjacent teeth. Even if some spaces to the adjacent teeth and the opposing teeth are left after the surgery, they will likely close naturally" <br />
"When patients have a tooth with an unfavorable prognosis or congenitally missing teeth and an appropriate donor tooth is preserved, transplants have several advantages over implants in terms of function, esthetics, time, and cost. Healing is rapid because of the viable PDL, even if there is a large bony defect in the recipient site. Ridge augmentation of recipient sockets using a membrane or bone graft materials is not necessary. Transplants have the potential for superior esthetic results because the natural emergence profile as well as the natural color and form of the enamel and crown are maintained. Usually, the total cost of transplantation is significantly lower than that of implant treatment." <br />
"Given that predictable and successful long‐term outcomes of autotransplantation of teeth are possible with relatively low risks and high benefits, ATT should be taken into consideration before other treatment alternatives when there is an appropriate donor tooth available."   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if there is a large bony defect in the recipient site, bone grafts are not necessary. Bone regeneration even occurs from autotransplantations.   </p>

"Mature, closed apex teeth can also be transplanted and maintain success over time; however, endodontic treatment is suggested frequently, as pulpal revascularization is unlikely." <br />
"If the transplant is a mature permanent tooth, endodontic treatment may be necessary, but alveolar bone would still be maintained. Whether the tooth is mature or immature, autotransplantation (AT) has been found to preserve and regenerate bone in the recipient site due to viable periodontal ligament cells"   </p>

"The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the long-term prognosis of autotransplanted premolars with respect to tooth survival and pulpal healing. The material consisted of 195 patients aged 7 to 35 years, with a total of 370 autotransplanted premolars with observation period ranged from 1 to 13 years. Teeth transplanted with incomplete and complete root formation showed 95 per cent and 98 per cent long-term survival respectively: Pulp healing as evaluated by sensibility testing and radiographic signs of partial pulp canal obliteration was usually verified 6 months after transplantation. The frequency of pulpal healing (versus pulp necrosis), appeared to be closely related to stage of root development at time of transplantation. Teeth transplanted with incomplete and complete root formation showed 96 per cent and 15 per cent pulp healing respectively."   </p>

"The participants in this study were 71 men (74 teeth) and 100 women (107 teeth) ranging from 25 to 69 years of age. Third molars were used as donor teeth in 89·0% of the cases. The participants were divided into three age groups of 25-39, 40-54 and 55-69. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a log-rank test revealed that there were no significant differences in age groups for men or women. Cox regression analysis indicated that the survival of transplanted teeth was not influenced by age. However, although not statistically significant, the clinical success rate was lower in the 55-69-year-old group than that in the younger groups. These results indicate that if suitable donor teeth are available and the conditions are right, autotransplantation is a viable treatment for missing teeth regardless of the age of the patient."   </p>

"According to some studies, tooth autotransplantation should ideally be performed when root formation has achieved 1/2 or 2/3 of the expected complete development [12,27,30]. This condition corresponds with a radiographically open apex, which allows for revascularization of the pulp and continued root growth [60]. Hence, root canal treatment (RCT) is not indicated after immature tooth transplantation, in contrast to fully developed transplanted teeth, in which RCT is indicated within the first 4 weeks after transplantation, as pulp regeneration is not expected"   </p>

"Autotransplantation of teeth is a considerable option for tooth replacement in adults who are to undergo orthodontic treatment. Being compared with dental implantation, this procedure is more preferable as a grafted tooth functions as a normal one" <br />
"A 34-year-old woman presented to the clinic" <br />
"As the patient was planning orthodontic treatment and the third molars were to be extracted, the patient was proposed for autotransplantation of a wisdom tooth to the edentulous area." <br />
"We initiated endodontic treatment 14 days after transplantation. Root canals were medicated with a calcium hydroxide paste and filled with gutta percha, 2 and 4 weeks after surgery, respectively" <br />
"At the moment, there are many options for tooth replacement, with autotransplantation being among them. If it is performed properly, a grafted tooth functions as a normal one.<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295376/#R8" class="external-link">8</a> It is particularly important in orthodontic patients since grafted teeth can be moved orthodontically." <br />
"In previous studies, only teeth with incomplete root formation were preferred for transplantation.<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295376/#R4" class="external-link">4</a> This conception was determined by a possibility of pulp vitality preservation through the process of revascularisation.<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295376/#R25" class="external-link">25</a> But choosing only such teeth significantly limits the indications for autotransplantation since in most adults root formation in the third molars has already been completed. Therefore, it was suggested to transplant mature teeth and perform endodontic treatment afterwards.<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295376/#R3" class="external-link">3</a> Nevertheless, Murtadha and Kwok observed the potential for revascularisation of pulp in teeth with complete root formation, so root canal treatment can be omitted in some cases.<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295376/#R26" class="external-link">26</a> However, we decided to administer a conventional treatment to decrease a risk of postoperative complications."   </p>

"A retrospective analysis of 209 patients 10 to 58 years old, with a total of 252 autotransplants was carried out with a minimum observational period of 1 year and a maximum period of 29 years. Patients were reviewed at specified intervals. Only the teeth showing any radiographic or clinical signs of internal resorption (IR), external resorption (ER), or pulpal necrosis underwent RCT. A failure was considered the loss or extraction of the autotransplanted tooth." <br />
"Despite the limitation of this long-term study of patients lost to follow-up, the results suggest that, with close monitoring, some autotransplanted teeth with complete root formation that do not undergo RCT could have the potential for revascularization. Hence, one could reconsider the protocol of routinely providing RCT after autotransplantation." <br />
"Retrospective analysis of the data showed that 184 autotransplanted teeth had complete root formation and 68 had incomplete root formation at the time of autotransplantation. Of the teeth that were followed for at least 5 years, 59.3% had complete root formation with no signs of pathology and required no root canal therapy (RCT)."   </p>

"Tooth germ autotransplantation of open apices of the teeth exhibits high pulpal healing rates, whereas that of mature permanent teeth normally causes irreversible pulpal necrosis. Extraoral root-end resection (EORER) during transplantation may promote pulpal revascularization (PRV) in transplanted mature teeth and reduce endodontic treatment requirement." <br />
"57 teeth were analyzed, including 25 mature teeth additionally treated with EORER. After a mean follow-up of 21.2 ± 16.1 months, no significant differences in primary outcomes were detected. Fifty-five teeth remained in situ (96.5%), and radiological signs of root resorption were detected in 9/57 teeth (15.8%). PRV was positive in 54/57 teeth (94.7%). Surgical duration and PRV failure were significantly associated with high incidences of root resorption. Mature teeth autotransplantation with EORER yielded similar results to immature teeth autotransplantation and is a feasible treatment option. Long surgery and failed revascularization increased root resorption rates. More factors should be evaluated in larger trials with longer observation periods." <br />
"The possibility of pulp revascularization (PRV) in immature teeth is good and is further facilitated by a large apical foramen diameter and a high number of apical stem cells [11,12]. A diameter of 0.2–0.4 mm, as found in the apical constrictions of mature premolars, reduces the PRV rate to almost zero [13]. The unlikeliness of endodontic healing is the major shortcoming in the transplantation of mature teeth. Endodontic failure often engenders rapid infection-related external root resorption. Thus, root canal treatment should be performed within 7–14 days in mature transplanted teeth" <br />
"In 2018, Jakse et al. [16] reported a clinical case of mature premolar transplantation combined with EORER that induced pulp revascularization. Another case [17] employing similar techniques was reported, followed by a retrospective study including 10 transplanted and root-end resected mature teeth [18]. Thus, successful revascularization can obviate the need for root canal treatment and thereby eliminates the main disadvantage in transplantation of mature teeth. [16,18]." <br />
"Herein, we aimed to compare the outcomes following the AT of immature teeth and mature teeth (combined with EORER). Primary outcomes included tooth survival, root resorption, and PRV. Factors that may influence outcomes, including general health, age, sex, donor type, recipient site, duration of surgery, period of splinting, and stage of root development, were evaluated." <br />
"Our results showed that survival, root resorption, and pulp revascularization were similar in the AT of immature teeth (IT) and mature teeth (MT) (with EORER)"" <br />
"The anatomical changes of the root due to EORER, including a larger apical foramen, shorter root, and simplified root canal configuration, may contribute to the relatively high rate of PRV (92%, 23/25; Table 3) in mature transplanted teeth. Herein, a wide apical opening was not associated with PRV. However, the minimum diameter of MT was 0.6 mm. All teeth exceeded the threshold of 0.5 mm specified by Fang et al. [12] owing to surgical resection of the apical constriction in MT" <br />
"In a recent retrospective study by Raabe et al. [18] included nine major transplanted and root-end resected teeth, with four remaining without postoperative findings (resorption, failure, and apico-marginal lesion) after 1.3–5.3 years. A 5-year survival probability of 50% (95% CI: 12.5–100%) was calculated. Most failures occurred in teeth with more than one root canal. Likewise, in a meta-analysis by Chung et al. [25], posterior donors were associated with a higher risk of failure (3.3%) compared with premolars (1.6%) and anterior donor teeth (0.6%). Thus, PRV is more likely to occur in teeth exhibiting simple root morphology. Furthermore, a multirooted tooth might evoke greater extraction and transplantation trauma, and consequently, be more susceptible to periodontal complications. According to Aoyama et al. [26], multirooted donors were associated with significantly higher failure rates (Hazard ratio 1–52.5 for single-rooted versus 3.2–170.1 for multirooted teeth). However, this was not supported by the findings of the present study. More complicated root anatomy might be associated with longer surgical durations, a factor that was significantly related to higher root resorption rates. However, this assumption was also not supported by the current study. The presence of multiple roots or canals did not influence the main outcome variables." <br />
"Prolonged and more difficult surgery can contribute to additional stress to the periodontal ligament and, thus, threaten the viability of the periodontal ligament cells [9]. In this context, the experience of surgeons might also be essential as the careful handling of the donor tooth is extremely important to minimize damage [8,27]. All four oral surgeons who performed the procedures in the current study were highly experienced." <br />
"Extra-oral time of the transplant can significantly influence the success rate of AT [28]. Consequently, applications for creating tooth replicas with high accuracy have been developed [16,29,30]. They can be used a model to validate the correct preparation of the recipient bed. Thus, the transplant can be reinserted immediately and as gently as possible after the extraction. If the preparation of the recipient site can only be performed after donor tooth removal, extra-oral storage is inevitable. Storing donor tooth in a cell nutrition media might diminish the negative effect of extraoral time on periodontal healing as it does not increase the risk of root resorption." ^28971f   </p>

"If applicable, contrast-enhanced MRI is a feasible method to demonstrate pulp revascularization (PRV) of transplanted teeth and thus to ensure a good prognosis, even of mature transplanted teeth. Histologically, the intracanal tissue of the presented tooth showed no odontoblasts, but fibrovascular connective tissue. These results indicate that PRV in transplanted root-end resected teeth is driven by bone marrow stem cells and stem cells from the periodontal ligament. Likewise, pulp canal obliteration is presumably caused by the ingrowth of intracanal cementum or bone and not by reparative dentin."   </p>

"The aim of this study was to examine the viability and efficacy of utilizing extraoral apicoectomy and retrograde filling in combination to seal the root canal system of mature molars without the need for root canal therapy (RCT) during the autotransplantation of teeth (ATT)." <br />
"This study screened 27 patients who received ATT at the Department of Oral Surgery in the Hospital of Stomatology from 2019 to 2021. Extraoral apicoectomy and retrograde filling were performed, while RCT was temporarily not performed. The study analysed the periodontal status and masticatory function of transplanted teeth one to three years postoperation" <br />
"Traditionally, it has been recommended to perform root canal therapy (RCT) on mature donor teeth within 2 weeks after surgery [6, 8], with crown restoration suggested at a later stage. However, the intricate and varied nature of root canal systems in wisdom teeth presents considerable difficulties when performing RCTs, despite advancements in technology [9–11]. Failure to fully complete RCT can ultimately lead to failure of the ATT [6, 8]. Furthermore, the cost of ATT treatment has significantly increased due to the need for RCT and crown restoration [12, 13]. If the extraoral apicoectomy and retrograde flling method can be performed without postoperative RCT, it has the potential to signifcantly reduce patient time and economic costs, as well as reduce the risks and difficulties associated with ATT [14]. According to clinical studies, patients who opt for apicoectomy or apicoectomy with retrofilling instead of conventional RCT for ATT may experience favorable clinical outcomes. This claim is backed by published case reports and research" <br />
"Extraoral apicoectomy combined with retrograde flling of the TT yielded relatively good results. However, the current study has some shortcomings, such as a small sample size and insufcient follow-up time. In some special cases, such as the complex root canal system of donor teeth that do not warrant perfect RCT, extraoral apicoectomy and retrograde flling to seal the root canal system can be used as alternatives or temporary treatment strategies for TT patients."   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extraoral root-end resection is the surgical removal of the apical portion (tip) of the root outside the mouth (extraorally), usually during intentional replantation. Extraoral apicoectomy is the same. But retrograde filling is an additional procedure where the retrograde cavity is prepared and filled with a biocompatible material to seal the root end to prevent infection.   </p>
