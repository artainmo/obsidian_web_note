      <p>A lot of women already use creams to maintain skin quality with age. But they often forget their eyebrows, while eyebrows start to thin after 40 years of age. This is unfortunate because eyebrows have significant aesthetic importance. This is why I will try to find solutions for the thinning of eyebrows with age. Those solutions could also help young people with thin eyebrows as eyebrow density is always considered attractive in both men and women.   </p>
<p>Eyelashes, like eyebrows, can thin and shorten with age. Similar solutions exist.    </p>
<p>Scalp hair also thins with age in women, especially after menopause. Some similar solutions exist. While men will experience a receding hairline with age, women will experience diffuse thinning at the crown and top of the head.   </p>
<h3 id="solutions-for-eyebrows">Solutions for eyebrows</h3>
<p><strong>Topicals</strong> <br />
Castor oil increases thickness, darkness, and moisturization of existing hair. Minoxidil can increase the amount of eyebrow hairs or prevent further loss. Bimatoprost 0.03% is also a cream that helps by making hair grow longer. 0.01% has also been proven to create results. Castor oil, minoxidil, and bimatoprost can be used together. They all bring different benefits via different mechanisms of action.  <br />
Apply for each cream, a small amount on a cotton swab or clean brush, massage it gently into the brows, and leave it on. Castor oil and minoxidil can be used twice a day, while bimatoprost should be used once a day.   <br />
Most results appear after 4 months but continued results are possible for 7-9 months.  <br />
Use pure castor oil that is not mixed with other ingredients. 2% minoxidil could be sufficient, however 5% minoxidil might be better if it doesn't cause irritation and is available without a prescription. Bimatoprost 0.03% may be more difficult to find; it is accessible as a prescription for glaucoma or thin eyelashes. Else, some websites sell it without a prescription (<a href="https://makeupshop.nl/en/product/385615/" class="external-link">1</a>, <a href="https://skinessential.eu/pages/buy-careprost-eyelash-growth-serum?_pos=2&amp;_sid=00102d18a&amp;_ss=r" class="external-link">2</a>, <a href="https://skinrenewal.eu/products/careprost-serum-3ml-eyelash-growth-serum?_pos=1&amp;_sid=a96eea1c9&amp;_ss=r" class="external-link">3</a>).     </p>
<p><strong>Medical interventions</strong> <br />
Estrogen helps keep hair (scalp and brows) in the growth phase for longer. When levels drop after menopause, hairs cycle out faster, and thinning becomes more noticeable. Progesterone can counterbalance androgens (like testosterone), which in excess can contribute to hair thinning or loss. <br />
For menopausal women, hormone therapy or creams, consisting of estrogen or progesterone can thus help.   </p>
<p>Some people may develop a sudden and strong lack of eyebrow hair or hair in general. This may be due to a medical condition that needs specific treatment.    </p>
<p><strong>Cosmetic procedures</strong> <br />
Microblading is an eyebrow tattoo that lasts 1-3 years. It could come with the risk of visible scaring after the tattoo fades, and I guess it could look unnatural as it is fake.   </p>
<p>Brow lamination is a cosmetic procedure that reshapes and “sets” the existing brow hairs to: create the illusion of density; for them too look polished; to lift them. Results last 4-8 weeks. It works best if you still have a moderate amount of brow hair as it won’t fill in very sparse areas.   </p>
<p>An eyebrow hair transplant is a cosmetic surgical procedure where hair follicles (typically harvested from the back of your scalp) are transplanted into sparse or missing eyebrow areas. Full results develop over 6 to 12 months and are permanent. Transplanted hair behaves like scalp hair, it's often coarser and grows longer than natural eyebrow hair, requiring regular trimming. Costs usually range between $ 3000-6000.    </p>
<h3 id="solutions-for-eyelashes">Solutions for eyelashes</h3>
<p><strong>Topicals</strong> <br />
Castor oil could also help eyelashes but in a limited way; it can moisturize then . Minoxidil is not safe to use on the eyelashes as contact with eyes can cause problems. Bimatoprost has a lot of evidence for eyelash growth. It can be medically prescribed for eyelash growth as the gold standard option. <br />

<p>Eyelash curlers are tools that can be used daily to curl the eyelashes and subsequently create a longer appearance. It comes with the risk of potentially damaging the eyelashes.   </p>
<p><strong>Medical interventions</strong> <br />
Systemic hormone therapy in menopausal women can sometimes improve hair density overall (scalp, brows, lashes) since estrogen helps keep follicles in growth phase. It is not prescribed just for lashes, but could offer a side benefit in women already using hormone therapy for other menopausal symptoms. <br />

<p>Sudden or patchy eyelash loss should be checked by a doctor, as it can point to medical issues. Treating that medical issue could restore eyelashes.   </p>
<p><strong>Cosmetic procedures</strong> <br />
Lash lifts uses a chemical solution to curl your natural lashes upward, making them look longer and more defined. It lasts 6-8 weeks. It requires having enough natural lashes to work with.   </p>
<p>To create lash extensions: individual synthetic, silk, or mink fibers are glued to your natural lashes one by one. It adds immediate length, thickness, and curl, and lasts 2-4 weeks. However, it can weaken natural lashes and are more costly.   </p>
<p>An eyelash transplant is a cosmetic surgical procedure where hair follicles (typically harvested from the back of your scalp) are transplanted into the eyelid margin. Full results develop over 6 to 12 months and are permanent. Transplanted hair behaves like scalp hair, they keep growing long and need regular trimming, curling, and care. Risks are: scarring or an unnatural look. It is rarely performed. Costs usually range between $ 2500-6000.    </p>
<h3 id="solutions-for-scalp-hair">Solutions for scalp hair</h3>
<p><strong>Topicals</strong> <br />
Castor oil could moisturize the scalp and coat hair to make them look shiner and thicker. But it probably won't grow new hair. Early research showed bimatoprost can stimulate scalp hair density. Minoxidil is approved for hair loss as it holds the strongest evidence. <br />

<p>With low-level laser therapy (LLLT), multiple studies show improved hair density and thickness in both men and women. It works best when combined with other treatments like minoxidil. It should be used at least three times a week. FDA-cleared devices (helmets, combs, caps) for LLT exist, they can be expensive: <span class="arithmatex">\(300–\)</span>3,000.   </p>
<p><strong>Medical interventions</strong> <br />
Systemic hormone therapy in menopausal women can sometimes improve hair density overall (scalp, brows, lashes) since estrogen helps keep follicles in growth phase. It is not prescribed just for hair, but could offer a side benefit in women already using hormone therapy for other menopausal symptoms. <br />

<p>Sudden and strong hair loss should be checked by a doctor, as it can point to medical issues. Treating that medical issue could restore hair loss.   </p>
<p><strong>Cosmetic procedures</strong> <br />
Finasteride can be used in men to prevent hair loss by blocking the androgen DHT. However, this can cause symptoms similar to low testosterone in men.   </p>
<p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy consists of injecting a concentrated plasma from your blood containing growth factors into the hair loss site. Multiple studies show PRP can increase hair density, thickness, and count, especially in women with early-to-moderate thinning.  Effects are not permanent — maintenance sessions are typically needed every 6–12 months. Typically <span class="arithmatex">\(1,500–\)</span>3,500 for an initial series, with maintenance costing ~<span class="arithmatex">\(500–\)</span>1,000 per session.   </p>
<p>With hair transplants, hair follicles (usually from the back of the scalp, where hair is more resistant to thinning) are transplanted into thinning areas. It is a permanent solution. The full visible results typically appear within 12 to 18 months after the initial procedure. Hair transplant costs vary significantly, ranging from approximately €1,000 to €10,000+.</p></div>
