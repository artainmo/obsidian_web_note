<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22508877/" class="external-link">An unusual variant of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis masquerading as tinea versicolor</a> <br />
"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP), also known as Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, is a rare disorder. It usually presents as hyperkeratotic brown papules that coalesce into plaques with a reticulated periphery on the central trunk of young adults. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is most often clinically confused with tinea versicolor and usually does not respond to therapy with antifungals. Minocycline is the treatment of choice."   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459130/" class="external-link">Confluent and Reticulated Papillomatosis</a> <br />
"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP), also known as Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, is caused by disordered keratinization. It presents with asymptomatic hyperpigmented papules that can coalesce into plaques and are typically located on the upper trunk and neck of teens and young adults. The cause of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is controversial. Historically, Malassezia furfur was thought to be the cause of the disease, but studies have since shown that patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis are not always colonized with Malassezia furfur. The current theory is infection with Dietzia papillomatosis, a gram-positive aerobic actinomycete. Other proposed causes include diabetes, obesity, ultraviolet light exposure, amyloidosis, and overexpression of keratin-16." <br />
<mark class="formatting_highlight">"First-line treatment is minocycline. The papules can take 12 to 39 months to resolve.</mark> There is a recurrence rate of 13.8% to 15.4%." <br />
"Changes in confluent and reticulated papillomatosis with changing weight and diabetes control support this theory. UV light can induce confluent and reticulated papillomatosis because it has an effect on melanogenesis and can cause transient epidermal hyperplasia. Amyloid deposits have been found in some patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, suggesting amyloidosis as a cause. Familial cases of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis could be due to overexpression of keratin-16." <br />
"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is reported to occur in different geographic areas and regions. It has a higher frequency in Caucasians. The Mayo Clinic conducted a study between 1972 and 2003 with 39 patients diagnosed with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis and determined the mean age of occurrence to be 15 years old with a range of 8 to 32 years and a male predilection of 1.4:1" <br />
"The diagnosis of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is clinical, but a skin biopsy can be performed to rule out other diseases. Findings on histopathology include:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Hyperkeratosis   </li>
<li>Papillomatosis   </li>
<li>Focal acanthosis   </li>
<li>Increased melanin pigmentation and melanosomes"   </li>
</ul>
<p>"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is mostly asymptomatic but can present with some pruritus. The disease is limited to the skin and presents as multiple 5 mm brown to hyperpigmented macules and papules in the center that can coalesce to form plaques with reticulation in the periphery. There can be some velvety or warty changes. The papules have epidermal changes, including scaling, hyperkeratosis, and/or atrophy. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis most commonly occurs on the upper trunk and axilla." <br />
"Davis et al. proposed five criteria for the diagnosis of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.  <br />
1. Clinical findings of scaling brown macules and patches, part of which appear reticulated and papillomatous <br />
2. Involvement of the upper trunk and neck <br />
3. Fungal staining is negative for fungus <br />
4. No response to antifungal treatment <br />
5. Excellent response to minocycline <br />
Jo et al. in 2014 proposed a change to the criteria. <br />
1. Scaly brown macules and patches with some appearing reticulated and papillomatous <br />
2. Involvement of the upper trunk, neck, or flexural areas <br />
3. Negative fungal staining or no response to antifungal treatment <br />
4. Excellent response to antibiotics <br />
<mark class="formatting_highlight">Differential diagnoses to consider are acanthosis nigricans, tinea versicolor, Dowling-Degos disease, Galli-Galli disease, dyskeratosis congenita, prurigo pigmentosa, terra firma-forme dermatosis, and Darier disease.</mark>" <br />
"First-line treatment is oral minocycline. Minocycline 50 mg twice a day for six weeks produces a good response with minimal side effects." <br />
"The use of antifungals is due in large part to the previous theory that Malassezia furfur causes confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. Topical selenium sulfide applied once a day for three weeks and then once a week for another three weeks produced a good response, but this could be due to its keratolytic properties. Other antifungals, such as ketoconazole, tolnaftate, and itraconazole, have worked, but recurrences were common." <br />
"Systemic retinoids, like isotretinoin and etretinate, have shown to be effective, but minocycline and azithromycin are safer and are preferred. Topical therapies such as topical retinoids, urea, calcipotriol, and tacrolimus have been successful." <br />
"Treatment can help with emotional distress and cosmetic appearance. Patients should be advised to keep the skin moisturized and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun."   </p>

"<mark class="formatting_highlight">Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis usually clears with a <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/tetracycline" class="external-link">tetracycline</a> (minocycline, doxycycline for 6–12 weeks)</mark> or a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin, clarithromycin, <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/erythromycin" class="external-link" class="external-link">erythromycin</a> for 4–6 weeks).

"A single course of minocycline or a macrolide antibiotic is reported to lead to remission for up to 2 years in many cases of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. <br />
Spontaneous resolution has been reported in a few cases but it may take up to 39 months for the eruption to clear up."   </p></div>
