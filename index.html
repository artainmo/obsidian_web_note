<p>I need to buy via a scientific research company for legal reasons (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). I can create a <em>Sole Proprietorship</em> in Belgium easily to resolve this issue. Later you can convert to a <em>Private Limited Company</em> for protection from personal liability and to scale the company's personnel.   </p>
<p>If I create this company, it could be of use for medical research (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), consultations (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>), and the selling of chemical technology (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).  <br />
When you incorporate, you need to declare your professional activity via a NACE code. The suggested NACE code combination for my activity is: '72.11 – Research in biotechnology' (medical/biomedical focus); '72.19 – Other natural sciences and engineering R&amp;D' (for flexibility in chemistry/engineering); '74.90 – Other professional, scientific, and technical activities' (for consulting/advisory); '46.75 – Wholesale of chemical products' (for selling/licensing chemical technology). <br />
You can describe your <em>sole proprietorship</em> in French like that: “Je souhaite enregistrer une entreprise individuelle ayant pour activité la recherche et le développement scientifique et médical (NACE 72.11 et 72.19), complétée par des services de consultation scientifique (NACE 74.90), et la commercialisation de technologies chimiques (NACE 46.75).”, or in Dutch: "Ik wil een eenmanszaak registreren met als activiteit wetenschappelijk en medisch onderzoek en ontwikkeling (NACE 72.11 en 72.19), aangevuld met wetenschappelijke consultancy (NACE 74.90) en de commercialisatie van chemische technologie (NACE 46.75).". <br />
It is illegal to do medical consultations without a medical license, thus it is important to specify 'research consultations' and not say 'medical consultations' (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>).    </p>
<p>To incorporate I need to register with a <em>business one-stop shop</em> (ondernemingsloket / guichet d’entreprises). Bring: ID card; proof of professional address (can be your home); description of activities (with NACE codes). They will: register your <em>sole proprietorship</em> in the <em>Crossroads Bank for Enterprises</em> (KBO/BCE); assign you an enterprise number. Also ask for a VAT number as this makes you appear more legitimate. Subsequently, create a bank account for the enterprise that is separate from your personal account, or for <em>sole proprietorship</em> you can reuse your personal bank account.   </p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.xerius.be/nl-be/zelfstandig-worden/starten/kiezen" class="external-link">xerius</a> to easily incorporate online on 15 September 2025. <br />
I used the company name <em>artainmo</em>. I used an <em>eenmanszaak</em> which means the company can only contain one person whereon all the responsibilities fall. But I can change the company structure later when necessary. <br />
As an enterprise who makes less than €25000 a year, I asked to not handle VAT. However, if in the end I do make more than that, I will need to contact my 'btw-controlekantoor' immediately.  <br />
To pay less social security, I indicated an expected income of less than €4391 for this year. If you make more than that you will need to pay a penalty. To limit the penalty, you need to notify about your higher income as fast as possible. Else, you need to indicate your expected income again each year, so you can adapt this on a yearly basis either way.  <br />
To sell chemical technologies you need certain authorizations, which is more complicated. This is why the company will for now not have that as an activity. I can add this activity later when I will actually be selling products. <br />
In a couple of days, Xerius will have created the <em>sole proprietorship</em>. I can follow this process <a href="https://www.xerius.be/nl-be/tool/aanvraag-detail/CfDJ8GMWEX662MRHtLxSnVTCaSSgXzFiHQWpTtU639QWG6_OfscSkE0FVN1ILk1oAJBkS7YOEKNBm5tJh21apCghmSrkMMvzbDIRlOfyHZ3DF4nLIxH-dFINTtV52Xp2SBh2-oemRK9AEVOqhtIO2P2R0H6v3SGU2LjXk-MiMK8ZRV85?aanbod=Opstart+Eenmanszaak" class="external-link">here</a>.   </p>
<p>The following document indicates all the official details about my incorporation. <br />
<img alt="" src="Uittreksel%20KBO%20-%201027628193.pdf" /> <br />
“73200 Markt- en opinieonderzoek” betekent “onderzoek naar productontwikkeling”. <br />
Thus my enterprise number is: '1027.628.193'.   </p>
<p>This is the official confirmation of my VAT being activated. <br />
<img alt="" src="Aanvraag%20tot%20identificatie%20voor%20btw-doeleinden%20bij%20aanvang%20van%20een%20activiteit.pdf" /> <br />
Thus my VAT number is 'BE1027.628.193'. <br />
As said earlier, I don't need to handle VAT as an enterprise who makes less than €25000. I still need to pay VAT, but I don't need to track and report it to the state which simplifies things a lot. Also, this makes me more discrete as the state isn't verifying exactly what I am doing. Thus the risk of them attacking me for a mistake is lower.   </p>
<p>I try to handle legal documents in <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">this note</a>.   </p>
<h3 id="realizing-the-social-security-problem">Realizing the social security problem</h3>
<p>I apparently need to pay €460 every three months for social security even if I have no income as this is the minimal amount. But this lasts one year, afterwards the minimal amount becomes around €800 every three months. <br />
This is way too expensive as I have no real income yet.   </p>
<p>Maybe I can avoid paying social security If I take on a job, then my enterprise would not be my <em>main profession</em> (hoofdberoep) anymore. This job could be fictitious at my father's company. <br />
Another solution may be to incorporate offshore. <br />
ChatGPT says: " <br />
1. Why you’re being asked €400–800/quarter now <br />
As a self-employed person in hoofdberoep (main profession), you’re legally required to pay social security contributions (RSZ via a social insurance fund). <br />
Even if you have no revenue, you still owe a minimum contribution — about €800 per quarter in 2025. <br />
This is not 'lost money': in theory, it builds your pension rights, healthcare coverage, etc. But for someone without revenue yet, it feels crushing. <br />
2. Solution 1: Change to bijberoep (side activity) <br />
If you have a job as employee (loontrekkende) or are on certain benefits, your self-employment can be registered as bijberoep (secondary activity). <br />
In bijberoep, you don’t pay the minimum contributions. Instead: if your revenue is low, you may pay zero or very small contributions; you only start paying significantly once your business income rises above ~€1,800–€2,000/year. <br />
This is the cleanest and most common way independent researchers or freelancers keep their business 'on standby' until revenue comes in. <br />
If you can take any part-time or full-time employee job in Belgium, you can immediately ask your social insurance fund to switch your eenmanszaak to bijberoep and avoid the minimum €800/quarter. <br />
3. Solution 2: Offshore incorporation <br />
Some people consider incorporating offshore (Estonia, Cyprus, Delaware, etc.) to avoid Belgian social security costs. <br />
But there are major risks: as a Belgian resident, Belgium will still tax your worldwide income and may consider your offshore company as 'Belgian-managed' if you run it from Linkebeek; you may still face social security contributions in Belgium if the activity is seen as personal income; offshore setups are complex, expensive, and usually overkill for a small research consultancy. <br />
Unless you plan to actually relocate your residency, offshore incorporation is not a practical escape. <br />
4. What I recommend for you <br />
Given your situation (independent research, not yet generating revenue, needing a legal entity mainly for procurement) the best option is to: take a part-time or full-time job in Belgium; switch your eenmanszaak to bijberoep; you’ll only pay social security when you actually make revenue. <br />
"   </p>
<p>Ask confirmation from Xerius that having a part-time or full-time job can make my enterprise qualify as 'bijberoep' to subsequently not pay social security when I have no enterprise income. <br />
Xerius confirms that a real (not internship) full-time of half-time job where the employer pays social security can allow me to classify my enterprise as 'bijberoep' to then not pay social security if I don't have revenue. <br />
I will have to pay social security for this quarter, and should start a job tomorrow if I want to not pay the next quarter.   </p>
<p>Ask Xerius if I can pause my enterprise to stop paying social security as I don't have active revenue either way, meaning I can easily reactivate my enterprise later on when revenue will arrive. <br />
Xerius says it is possible to deactivate my enterprise for the same price as the enterprise creation (€180), and later reactivate it for the same price as the enterprise creation (€180). <br />
I will have to pay social security for this quarter, and should deactivate the enterprise today if I don't want to pay the next quarter. <br />
However, if I close the enterprise as being 'en faillite' (which really is the case as I don't have revenue to pay the social security), do I still need to pay the social security of this quarter?   </p>
<p>I already ordered the tipepidine and hope this will still go down. I decided to stop the enterprise to avoid continued social security payments I cannot pay yet as my father's enterprise won't employ me. Here are the details of the enterprise deactivation: <br />
