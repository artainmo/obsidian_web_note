      <p>I asked chatGPT: "I write medical research like this one: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.26599/BSA.2024.905006." class="external-link">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.26599/BSA.2024.905006.</a> However, I am not an official medical doctor. This is why I received he title 'consultant' on that research article. I even performed reviews for medical journals of Elsevier as you can see on my ORCID: <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0781-684X." class="external-link">https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0781-684X.</a> Is it even legal to do medical research without being an official medical doctor?", and chatGPT answered: " <br />
The short answer is: yes, it is legal to do medical research without being a medical doctor, but there are important boundaries and conditions. <br />
1. Medical Research vs. Medical Practice <br />
Medical practice (diagnosing, prescribing, treating patients) generally requires a medical license (e.g., MD, DO). Medical research (designing studies, analyzing data, writing papers, reviewing manuscripts) does not require you to be a licensed physician. Many medical researchers come from biology, biostatistics, public health, biomedical engineering, or related fields. <br />
2. Who Can Publish Medical Research <br />
Journals care about scientific merit, methodology, and peer review, not whether the author holds a medical degree. Titles such as 'consultant', 'researcher', 'scientist', or 'PhD candidate' are often used when authors are not MDs. As long as your role and credentials are accurately represented, it is legitimate. <br />
4. Peer Review Without Being a Doctor <br />
Journals recruit reviewers based on expertise, not on medical licensing. If your background matches the subject (e.g., data science, pharmacology, molecular biology), you may be invited to review. This is completely legitimate, provided you disclose your expertise honestly. <br />
5. Legal Risks <br />
Not illegal: Writing papers, analyzing data, publishing, or reviewing. <br />
Illegal (in most countries): Presenting yourself as a licensed physician when you are not, or practicing medicine without a license. <br />
As long as you don’t misrepresent your qualifications, you are safe. <br />
6. Conclusions <br />
It is perfectly legal for you to do and publish medical research without being a medical doctor. Many researchers in biomedical fields are not MDs. What matters is honesty about your role and following ethical guidelines (especially for studies involving patients or clinical data). <br />
".   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "You said: 'Titles such as consultant, researcher, scientist, or PhD candidate are often used when authors are not MDs.'. Why would a researcher without a medical degree present himself as a consultant? Can he indeed give medical advice through consultations?", and he answered: " <br />
The word 'consultant' can mean very different things in research versus in medicine, and this distinction is crucial. <br />
1. 'Consultant' in Research <br />
In academic publishing, 'consultant' usually just means someone who contributed expert knowledge in a specialized field (e.g., statistics, bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, medical writing). It does not imply medical licensure or the ability to provide patient care. <br />
2. 'Consultant' in Medicine (Clinical Context) <br />
In the UK, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, 'Consultant' is a formal title for a senior physician who has completed all specialist training. In that sense, it explicitly means 'medical doctor at the top of their specialty'. Using that title in this way without an MD and specialist certification would be misleading and possibly unlawful. <br />
3. Can a Non-MD Give Medical Advice? <br />
No. Unless you are a licensed physician (or in some cases, a licensed healthcare provider like a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical psychologist depending on jurisdiction), you cannot legally give personalized medical advice or treatment plans to patients. However, non-MDs can consult on research projects, data analysis, medical writing, or regulatory aspects of studies. This is legitimate as long as it’s clear that the consultation is scientific/technical, not clinical care. <br />
4. Best Practice for You <br />
Always clarify in publications that your role as 'consultant' is research/technical. If you are asked to review papers or contribute to projects, present yourself as a scientific consultant/researcher, not a medical consultant. Never use 'Consultant Physician' or similar titles unless you are formally licensed as such. <br />
5. Conclusions: <br />
A non-MD can absolutely be called a consultant in a research paper — it means you contributed expertise, not that you are treating patients. <br />
"   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "You previously said: 'If your research involves human subjects, tissue samples, or clinical trials, you must comply with: Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Ethics Committee approval; Informed consent regulations; Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.'. Does this mean you cannot do research on human subjects without holding a medical degree?", and he answered: " <br />
Great follow-up — this is where the distinction between who leads research and who participates in research really matters.   </p>
