      <p>Create an obsidian plugin / contribute to open-source. <br />
Can be interesting experience and interesting on your cv in worse case, can be a financially successful startup in best case.   </p>
<p>I don't believe people would want to pay for such a service when you see that obsidian plugins are usually free, and that most LLM are free to use to a certain extent. Thus, maybe make the project open-source (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">open-source, programming</a>). I guess a free product can acquire more users and thus create more prestige for the founders. Also, it allows me to move on one day and let others manage the project.   </p>
<h1 id="obsidian-llm">Obsidian LLM</h1>
<p>Create a chatbot that can answer questions based on information from an obsidian vault.   </p>
<p>Create an LLM that can be fine tuned with own notes. This could be done with an AWS ML service or by fine-tuning with labeled data an Hugging Face Model. See AWS course and last machine learning course.  <br />
Amazon Kendra could be used to find relevant responses to natural language questions in repositories of text.   </p>
<p>This project could allow the creation of such a fine-tuned model: <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">AI, machine-learning, startup-idea</a>.   </p>
<p>Maybe the place where you query the AI could be a home page. On that home page you would have one place to query but also a listing of all the tags. AI could be used to group the tags in different categories. <br />
However, the current version of obsidian uses constant side-bar menus as a replacement of a home page. Thus, maybe I should align with that. Put an 'ask' icon on the top bar to open the AI search page. The tag list in the right side-bar could be displayed differently as another project.   </p>
<p>Use the AWS Titan LLM to perform transfer learning on. Finish the course I got from 19, to do the AWS Titan part. Ask Edouard if AWS Titan is worth it.   </p>
<p>However, NotebookLM already exists and does something similar. Maybe I could use its API?   </p>
<p>Maybe combine Amazon Kendra with an LLM. First use Amazon Kendra to show where in the vault the question answers could lie. Subsequently, use an LLM to take those answers and synthesize a conclusion from it.   </p>
<p>RAG in the context of LLMs takes texts initially, and answers a subsequent question based on that. This is an algorithm I could use. I can ask Arthur Vandecan about it. <br />
Not only Arthur Vandecan, Edouard also confirmed me that RAG is the algorithm I should use. RAG would even be better than Amazon Kendra (because Kendra uses a simple search engine), while creating a RAG locally is free. <a href="https://cohere.com/" class="external-link">Cohere</a> integrates RAGs for other enterprises.   </p>
<h2 id="other-possibilities-with-this-ai">Other possibilities with this AI</h2>
<p>An AI that can find answers in large arrays of texts can be useful in different fields. Not only for Obsidian. For example, it can be useful in law (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">legal, startup-idea</a>), but also in medicine (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">AI, digital-medicine, future-vision, medicine, startup-idea</a>).   </p>
<h1 id="other-obsidian-plugins">Other obsidian plugins</h1>
<p>Maybe I could transform my other obsidian projects found on github into obsidian plugins.   </p></div>
