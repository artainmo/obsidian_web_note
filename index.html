<p>I would like to have the product myself.  <br />
It would drastically improve health of the population.  <br />
Cigarettes, vaping products, and nicotine replacement therapy form a 983 billion USD market, thus the market size is huge, enabling a unicorn.  <br />
I believe I have unique knowledge, giving me an unfair business advantage, which allowed me to know how to make this project feasible and which explains why it has not been done yet. <br />
I don't think new technology will take over my current solution in the future. <br />
I think the product is sufficiently superior to what is currently available to be worth buying even if the brand is initially unknown.   </p>

<h6 id="have-you-already-raised-founds-how-have-you-planning-on-doing-so">Have you already raised founds ? How have you planning on doing so ?</h6>
<p>No rounds have been raised. I plan on doing so after having a working product to show off and associated patent to protect the idea, or at least a business plan and working MVP with some patent.   </p>

<h6 id="name-logo-and-email-of-the-startup">Name, logo and email of the startup.</h6>
<p>The name will be: SNICA. SNICA stands for 'smart nicotine alternative'. The logo is not defined yet. The current email address is the one from the founder: tainmontarthur@icloud.com.   </p>
<h6 id="description-of-the-startup_1">Description of the startup.</h6>
<p>SNICA will provide a healthy alternative to cigarettes, vaping products and nicotine replacement therapy.   </p>

<p>It will make a stick to hold between lips. The part lying in the mouth will melt to release psychoactive molecules who are transformed to allow fast buccal absorption. Those molecules create similar psychoactive properties as nicotine while being innocuous for the organism. The melting stick will also release other molecules who improve taste, smell and coloration of the product while providing various health benefits, especially for oral health and the microbiome, but ultimately the whole organism, and improving breath, lowering nausea, and improving cognition.    </p>
<h6 id="why-did-you-pick-this-idea-to-work-on_1">Why did you pick this idea to work on?</h6>
<p>I would like to have the product myself.  <br />

<p>It would take some weeks to define the exact product specifications. Then it would probably take another couple of weeks to produce the actual product in a lab. After that, another couple of weeks to bring it to market. Thus, in the best scenario, the product could come to market after 6 months.   </p>
<h6 id="detailed-description-of-your-product-from-a-customer-point-of-view-what-are-you-going-to-offer-which-problem-does-your-service-solves">Detailed description of your product from a customer point of view. What are you going to offer/which problem does your service solves?</h6>
<p>SNICA solves the problem of nicotine products being unhealthy and creating bad breath by creating an alternative to improve health and breath. Just not using nicotine is not an option, some people have difficulties quitting nicotine, and some even never feel satisfied again after quitting as nicotine's psychoactive properties helps their neurochemistry. <br />
The psychoactive molecules solve the problems: low mood, high stress, low attention and focus, low social function, low effortful behavior, low cognition, and daytime fatigue; like nicotine would to improve life quality and productivity.  <br />
Other molecules create a pleasurable consumption experience to solve the problem of boredom throughout the day. But also they improve health, especially oral health and the microbiome, but ultimately the whole organism's health, to solve the problem of society's modern lifestyle often being physically unhealthy. Lastly, they improve breath. <br />
Ultimately, SNICA solves the problem of society's modern lifestyle being mentally and physically unhealthy for a lot of people, or that some in general have bad mental/physical health.   </p>
<h6 id="are-products-or-services-in-development-or-existing-and-on-the-market">Are products or services in development or existing (and on the market)?</h6>
<p>The product design is in development. But the product is not produced or on the market yet.   </p>
<h6 id="who-are-your-customers-how-are-you-planning-on-contacting-them">Who are your customers? How are you planning on contacting them?</h6>
<p>Initially, the customers will be nicotine product users. Back when tobacco wasn't considered unhealthy, most adults smoked. Thus eventually, all adult humans, but maybe even adolescents, will be potential customers. Influencer marketing, availability in physical stores, and word of mouth can be used for advertisement.   </p>
<h6 id="have-you-already-raised-rounds-how-are-you-planning-on-doing-so">Have you already raised rounds? How are you planning on doing so?</h6>
<p>No rounds have been raised. I plan on doing so after having a working product to show off and associated patent to protect the idea, or at least a business plan and working MVP with some patent.   </p>
<h3 id="current-final-project-verdict">Current final project verdict</h3>
<p>The <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">healthy alcohol startup idea</a> has more advantages and is easier to produce than this healthy cigarette idea and thus is better as a first startup. More advantages because it has more health benefits since nicotine itself isn't super bad for health either (while nicotine pouches already exist), but also because it acts on other things than health such as: hangovers, calories/weight-gain, driving under the influence, diabetes... It is easier to produce because the psychoactive molecules just need to be mixed in a drink and don't need transformation for buccal absorption or placement within a stick. ^512a85   </p>
