      <h3 id="what-can-you-do-without-being-a-md">What can you do without being a MD?</h3>
<p>I asked chatGPT: "I write medical research like this one: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.26599/BSA.2024.905006." class="external-link">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.26599/BSA.2024.905006.</a> However, I am not an official medical doctor. This is why I received he title 'consultant' on that research article. I even performed reviews for medical journals of Elsevier as you can see on my ORCID: <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0781-684X." class="external-link">https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0781-684X.</a> Is it even legal to do medical research without being an official medical doctor?", and chatGPT answered: " <br />
The short answer is: yes, it is legal to do medical research without being a medical doctor, but there are important boundaries and conditions. <br />
1. Medical Research vs. Medical Practice <br />
Medical practice (diagnosing, prescribing, treating patients) generally requires a medical license (e.g., MD, DO). Medical research (designing studies, analyzing data, writing papers, reviewing manuscripts) does not require you to be a licensed physician. Many medical researchers come from biology, biostatistics, public health, biomedical engineering, or related fields. <br />
2. Who Can Publish Medical Research <br />
Journals care about scientific merit, methodology, and peer review, not whether the author holds a medical degree. Titles such as 'consultant', 'researcher', 'scientist', or 'PhD candidate' are often used when authors are not MDs. As long as your role and credentials are accurately represented, it is legitimate. <br />
4. Peer Review Without Being a Doctor <br />
Journals recruit reviewers based on expertise, not on medical licensing. If your background matches the subject (e.g., data science, pharmacology, molecular biology), you may be invited to review. This is completely legitimate, provided you disclose your expertise honestly. <br />
5. Legal Risks <br />
Not illegal: Writing papers, analyzing data, publishing, or reviewing. <br />
Illegal (in most countries): Presenting yourself as a licensed physician when you are not, or practicing medicine without a license. <br />
As long as you don’t misrepresent your qualifications, you are safe. <br />
6. Conclusions <br />
It is perfectly legal for you to do and publish medical research without being a medical doctor. Many researchers in biomedical fields are not MDs. What matters is honesty about your role and following ethical guidelines (especially for studies involving patients or clinical data). <br />
".   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "You said: 'Titles such as consultant, researcher, scientist, or PhD candidate are often used when authors are not MDs.'. Why would a researcher without a medical degree present himself as a consultant? Can he indeed give medical advice through consultations?", and he answered: " <br />
The word 'consultant' can mean very different things in research versus in medicine, and this distinction is crucial. <br />
1. 'Consultant' in Research <br />
In academic publishing, 'consultant' usually just means someone who contributed expert knowledge in a specialized field (e.g., statistics, bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, medical writing). It does not imply medical licensure or the ability to provide patient care. <br />
2. 'Consultant' in Medicine (Clinical Context) <br />
In the UK, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, 'Consultant' is a formal title for a senior physician who has completed all specialist training. In that sense, it explicitly means 'medical doctor at the top of their specialty'. Using that title in this way without an MD and specialist certification would be misleading and possibly unlawful. <br />
3. Can a Non-MD Give Medical Advice? <br />
No. Unless you are a licensed physician (or in some cases, a licensed healthcare provider like a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical psychologist depending on jurisdiction), you cannot legally give personalized medical advice or treatment plans to patients. However, non-MDs can consult on research projects, data analysis, medical writing, or regulatory aspects of studies. This is legitimate as long as it’s clear that the consultation is scientific/technical, not clinical care. <br />
4. Best Practice for You <br />
Always clarify in publications that your role as 'consultant' is research/technical. If you are asked to review papers or contribute to projects, present yourself as a scientific consultant/researcher, not a medical consultant. Never use 'Consultant Physician' or similar titles unless you are formally licensed as such. <br />
5. Conclusions: <br />
A non-MD can absolutely be called a consultant in a research paper — it means you contributed expertise, not that you are treating patients. <br />
"   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "You previously said: 'If your research involves human subjects, tissue samples, or clinical trials, you must comply with: Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Ethics Committee approval; Informed consent regulations; Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.'. Does this mean you cannot do research on human subjects without holding a medical degree?", and he answered: " <br />
Great follow-up — this is where the distinction between who leads research and who participates in research really matters. <br />
1. Do you need a medical degree to do human-subject research? <br />
No — you don’t need to be a medical doctor to conduct research on human subjects. <br />
What you do need is: Ethics/IRB approval before starting; To follow local/national regulations (e.g., the U.S. Common Rule, EU Clinical Trials Regulation, ICH-GCP); To have the right training and supervision for what you’re doing. <br />
2. Who typically conducts human research? <br />
MDs: often lead clinical trials that involve diagnosis, treatment, or drug administration, because only licensed physicians can perform those activities. <br />
Non-MD scientists (PhDs, MPH, PharmDs, psychologists, engineers, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, etc.): Frequently design, analyze, and even lead studies involving humans, as long as they are not providing direct medical care. <br />
3. Where the line is drawn <br />
If the research requires medical judgment or intervention (e.g., prescribing drugs, performing surgery, making diagnoses), an MD must be involved. <br />
If the research is observational, survey-based, data-driven, laboratory-based, or device-related, then a non-MD can often be the lead researcher — provided ethics approvals and institutional rules are followed. <br />
4. Conclusion: <br />
You can absolutely conduct research on human subjects without a medical degree — but you must stay within your professional scope. As long as you’re not acting as a physician (treating, diagnosing, prescribing), your role is legal and valid, provided you follow ethics approval and regulatory requirements. <br />
"   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "And what about human research on a smaller scale such as with case studies? Can a non-MD perform case studies where he tries a certain drug on a certain patient? And where do the used drugs in research come from?", and he answered: " <br />
Excellent questions — and this is where the line between research and medical practice becomes very sharp. <br />
1. Case Studies and Non-MDs <br />
Case reports/case studies usually describe a treatment or event that already happened in the course of normal medical care. <br />
A non-MD cannot legally prescribe or administer drugs to patients in order to 'try out' something for a case study. That would be practicing medicine without a license, which is illegal in most jurisdictions. <br />
However, a non-MD researcher can: analyze and write up case studies if they are co-authoring with the treating physician who provided the care; collect retrospective data (with ethics approval) from hospital or medical records; publish case reports if working within a clinical team, with the licensed clinician as the responsible author. <br />
2. Where Do Research Drugs Come From? <br />
Approved drugs (on the market): used in 'off-label' ways sometimes — but only if prescribed by a licensed physician. <br />
Investigational (experimental) drugs: provided by pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms, or academic labs. These cannot be handed to an unlicensed individual to 'try out' on patients — they must go through a registered clinical trial. <br />
3. Key Legal/Ethical Boundary <br />
Only licensed clinicians can test drugs directly on patients. <br />
Non-MDs can research drugs in many ways: preclinical studies (lab, animal models, simulations); observational/retrospective human data studies; collaborating on clinical trials (design, analysis, reporting); working as part of the research team under a physician-PI. <br />
4. Bottom line: <br />
A non-MD cannot 'try a drug on a patient' for research — that’s clinical practice and requires a medical license. But non-MDs can (and often do) contribute heavily to drug research, case studies, and publications — provided the patient-facing part is done by a licensed doctor and ethics/IRB approval is in place. <br />

<p>It seems like I can do research but not direct medical care of a patient. This includes medical care of a patient in the context of research.   </p>

<h3 id="where-can-mds-practice">Where can MDs practice?</h3>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "Can a Belgian doctor prescribe medications to patients in other countries?", and he answered: " <br />
The short answer is: generally no, a Belgian doctor cannot legally prescribe medications to patients in other countries, unless very specific conditions are met. <br />
1. Medical Licensure is National <br />
Medical licenses are typically valid only in the country (or region) where they were issued. <br />
A Belgian doctor is licensed to practice medicine in Belgium (and possibly in certain EU countries under mutual recognition agreements). <br />
Prescribing for patients abroad usually requires a local medical license, otherwise it may be considered illegal practice of medicine without a license in the patient’s country. <br />
2. EU Specifics <br />
Within the EU/EEA, there are some harmonized rules. <br />
Prescriptions from one EU country can sometimes be recognized in another. <br />
3. Outside the EU <br />
Most non-EU countries (e.g., U.S., Canada, Asian countries) do not recognize EU prescriptions at all. A Belgian doctor writing a prescription for a patient living in the U.S. would have no legal effect — pharmacies there would reject it. <br />
4. Telemedicine Across Borders <br />
Cross-border telemedicine is a legal gray zone. <br />
In Belgium (and most EU countries), a doctor is only supposed to treat patients who are physically present in Belgium or under Belgian care. <br />
5. Practical Reality <br />
If a Belgian doctor wants to treat patients abroad, they usually need: local licensure (or temporary registration in that country). <br />
6. Conclusion: <br />
A Belgian doctor cannot normally prescribe medication directly to patients in other countries, unless it’s within the EU under limited recognition rules (and even then, pharmacies may reject it). For regular treatment, patients must have prescriptions from a doctor licensed in their own country. <br />
".   </p>
<p>You can ask your doctor to give you a prescription to use in another EU country, also known as a "cross-border prescription".   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "If you are a Belgian doctor, can you easily get a local licensure to prescribe in the US for example?", and he answered: " <br />
That’s a very good (and common) question among internationally trained doctors. Unfortunately, the answer is: no, it is not easy for a Belgian (or any foreign-trained) doctor to get licensed to prescribe in the U.S. <br />
1. U.S. Licensure Basics <br />
In the U.S., each state regulates medical practice and licensure. <br />
To prescribe medications, you need: a state medical license (from the state’s medical board); a DEA registration (from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration) if you will prescribe controlled substances. <br />
2. Pathway for Foreign-Trained Doctors (e.g., from Belgium) <br />
First, Credential verification via the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) will check that your medical degree is valid and from a recognized institution. <br />
Second, you must pass the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination). <br />
Third you need residency in US. Even if you are already a specialist in Belgium, most foreign doctors must repeat at least part of U.S. residency training. This is often the biggest hurdle (competitive and time-consuming). <br />
Fourth, after completing residency and exams, you apply for a license in the state where you want to practice. <br />
Lastly you can register with the DEA to prescribe controlled substances.  <br />
4. Practical Reality <br />
A Belgian doctor would usually need to go through years of exams and U.S. training before being able to prescribe in the U.S. <br />
"   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "If you have a license in one US state, can you easily also prescribe in other US states?", and he answered: " <br />
Licensure in one U.S. state does not automatically grant the right to prescribe in other states. <br />
You can usually get licensure in additional states, often faster if the state participates in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, but an application and approval are still required. <br />
".   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a Belgian doctor you can only prescribe in Belgium and maybe other EU countries.  <br />
If wanting to prescribe in the US, you usually only have a license in one state and thus prescribe in one state only. However, accessing additional licenses to also prescribe in other states doesn't seem too difficult.      </p>

<h3 id="collaborating-with-mds">Collaborating with MDs</h3>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "I am a non-MD researcher. I would like to partner with doctors all over the world. I would write a report for treatment-resistant-patients using my research knowledge to find them a treatment that could theoretically work. I would give this report to a local doctor who would approve and prescribe or not the treatment to the patient. Thus, while I would just do research for a patient, a licensed doctor would do the actual final patient care. However, how can I find those doctors that would be open to work with me? Via hiring platforms, or by contacting telemedicine doctors?", and he answered: " <br />
You’re thinking along the right lines — what you describe is essentially a <em>research-informed clinical consulting collaboration</em>, where you contribute expertise while the licensed physician maintains legal responsibility for patient care. That is entirely feasible, but connecting with the right doctors is key. Here’s a structured approach: <br />
1. Types of Doctors to Partner With: <br />
Specialists in the relevant field: e.g., oncologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, cardiologists — depending on the disease or treatment type. <br />
Doctors open to research or off-label treatment collaborations: often affiliated with teaching hospitals, academic medical centers, or clinical trials. <br />
Telemedicine doctors: some are more flexible but still must operate within legal limits of their jurisdiction. <br />
2. How to Find Doctors Open to Collaboration <br />
Cold emailing doctors with: your credentials and ORCID profile; research focus; clear description of your role (research, not prescribing); proposed collaboration framework (doctor reviews and approves treatment). Transparency about your non-MD status is essential. <br />
3. How to Structure the Collaboration Legally <br />
Non-MD researcher role: you generate evidence-based reports, provide literature review, suggest potential treatments. <br />
Licensed physician role: reviews your report, evaluates patient safety, makes the final prescribing decision. <br />
Documentation: clearly state in writing that you do research/consulting only, and the doctor retains full clinical responsibility. <br />
".   </p>
<p>Subsequently I asked chatGPT in the same discussion: "Can you elaborate on 'research-informed clinical consulting collaboration'?", and he answered: " <br />
let’s break down what a 'research-informed clinical consulting collaboration' means, how it works, and why it’s legal and practical for a non-MD researcher like you. <br />
1. Core Concept <br />
A research-informed clinical consulting collaboration is a partnership where: you (the researcher) contribute scientific expertise, data analysis, literature reviews, or treatment hypotheses based on evidence; the licensed physician retains full responsibility for patient care, evaluates your findings, and decides whether to implement any recommendations. <br />
The key idea: you influence the research and potential treatment options without engaging in actual clinical practice, which keeps you within legal and ethical boundaries. <br />
2. Roles &amp; Responsibilities   </p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>3. Benefits of This Collaboration <br />
For researchers: you can directly see the impact of your work without risking illegal medical practice. <br />
For doctors: They gain access to additional analysis, evidence synthesis, or treatment hypotheses they might not have time to generate themselves. <br />
For patients: Potential access to novel, evidence-based options in a safe, physician-supervised environment. <br />
4. Legal and Ethical Considerations <br />
You must never present yourself as a physician. <br />
All final treatment decisions and patient interactions must be handled by the licensed doctor. Data sharing must comply with privacy regulations (HIPAA in the U.S., GDPR in the EU). For off-label or experimental therapies, ensure ethics review or IRB oversight if required. <br />
5. Summary <br />
A research-informed clinical consulting collaboration is essentially a division of labor between expertise and legal responsibility: you provide the scientific insight, and the licensed doctor provides the medical authority and patient-facing decision-making. <br />
"   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can hold the researcher role to: generate an evidence-based report (tailored to the patient) that provides literature review and suggests potential treatments. I can collaborate with a local licensed physician who: reviews my report, evaluates patient safety and makes the final prescribing decision.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT proposed me to: "sketch a practical workflow diagram showing step-by-step how this collaboration would operate from patient case to research report to physician approval", I accepted, and he answered: " <br />
Here’s a practical workflow diagram for a research-informed clinical consulting collaboration. <br />
Step 1: Patient Case Identification <br />
Doctor identifies a treatment-resistant patient. Doctor collects relevant medical history, labs, imaging, etc., with patient consent. <br />
Step 2: Data Sharing &amp; Research Brief <br />
Doctor securely shares anonymized patient data with you (or full data with proper consent). You (researcher) review existing literature, clinical trials, and potential treatment strategies. You generate a research-informed report: evidence-based treatment options; mechanisms of action; potential risks and theoretical benefits. <br />
Step 3: Physician Review <br />
Licensed doctor reviews your report. Evaluates feasibility, safety, and regulatory compliance. Decides which, if any, of your recommendations are clinically appropriate. <br />
Step 4: Clinical Decision &amp; Treatment <br />
Doctor communicates with the patient. Prescribes treatment or adjusts plan as appropriate.  <br />
Step 5: Monitoring &amp; Feedback <br />
Doctor monitors patient outcomes.  <br />
Feedback may be shared with you for further research refinement.  <br />
Data contributes to future case studies or research publications. <br />
"   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would maybe adapt this workflow, where the patient first comes to me, for me to create a report I send to the physician.   </p>

<h3 id="loopwhole">Loopwhole</h3>
<p>I asked chatGPT: "Giving medical advice without a medical license is illegal. But if I live in Belgium and propose medical advice to someone in another country, can the other country penalize me legally or am I protected by living in another country?", and he answered: " <br />
1. The Core Principle <br />
Giving personalized medical advice without a license is considered practicing medicine without authorization, which is illegal in almost every jurisdiction. But enforcement depends on: where you are physically located (Belgium); where the patient is located (the other country); how the advice was delivered (general education, research presentation, direct patient instructions).  <br />
2. Jurisdiction in Cross-Border Cases <br />
If you give advice to someone in the U.S., for example, U.S. regulators could theoretically claim jurisdiction because the effect (the advice) occurred within the U.S. In practice, prosecuting a foreign individual living abroad is complex and rare, unless the case causes significant harm or public health risk. <br />
Belgian law applies to you as a resident/citizen. If Belgian authorities view your activities as 'illegal practice of medicine', they can investigate and prosecute even if the patient is abroad.  <br />
3. Real-World Enforcement <br />
Most cross-border enforcement happens in serious cases (fraud, harm, large-scale illegal telemedicine operations). <br />
For individual advice, authorities usually target people physically in their jurisdiction (e.g., unlicensed 'telemedicine doctors' operating inside the U.S.). <br />
However, Belgium can still hold you accountable if you present yourself as a medical practitioner without a Belgian license, even if the patient is not Belgian. <br />
4. Protection or Risk? <br />
You are not 'protected' just because you live in Belgium.  <br />
Both Belgium and the patient’s country could act against you, depending on the seriousness of the case. <br />
More realistically: if you are transparent as a researcher and not giving direct patient instructions, your risk is minimal; if you frame it as research insights for doctors (not patients), you stay in a safer legal zone. <br />
5. Safer Alternative (Your Case) <br />
Instead of advising patients directly: provide research reports to licensed doctors, who make the final decision; clearly state in writing that your work is scientific/educational, not clinical advice. This way, you avoid being accused of 'practicing medicine' and keep your role legitimate. <br />
".   </p>
<p>I subsequently asked chatGPT: "You said enforcement also depends on how the advice was delivered (online, email, phone, platform)?", and he answered: " <br />
The delivery channel matters because it influences both legal interpretation and jurisdiction. <br />
1. Public or Generalized Information (Lower Risk) <br />
Mode: Publishing a paper, blog, YouTube video, or research report intended for the public. <br />
Legal view: If framed as educational content ('Studies suggest Drug X has shown promise in resistant cases'), that’s usually protected as free expression or academic speech. <br />
Jurisdiction: Very low risk, unless you misrepresent yourself as a physician. <br />
4. Platform-Based Interactions <br />
Telemedicine platforms: Some require all contributors to be licensed physicians in the jurisdiction. If you present yourself as a 'consultant doctor', that’s risky. <br />
Research platforms / clinical trial collaborations: Safer, since they’re structured around research, not direct care. <br />
"   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Giving medical advice to patients in other countries is low risk because their country probably won't make the effort to legally attack my small activity across borders as this is complex.  <br />
On the other hand, my own country could still legally attack me if I portray myself as giving medical advise without a license. Thus I need to be careful with how I present my activity on my website.   </p>
