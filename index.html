<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22508877/" class="external-link">An unusual variant of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis masquerading as tinea versicolor</a> <br />
"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP), also known as Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, is a rare disorder. It usually presents as hyperkeratotic brown papules that coalesce into plaques with a reticulated periphery on the central trunk of young adults. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is most often clinically confused with tinea versicolor and usually does not respond to therapy with antifungals. Minocycline is the treatment of choice."   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459130/" class="external-link">Confluent and Reticulated Papillomatosis</a> <br />
"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP), also known as Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, is caused by disordered keratinization. It presents with asymptomatic hyperpigmented papules that can coalesce into plaques and are typically located on the upper trunk and neck of teens and young adults. The cause of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is controversial. Historically, Malassezia furfur was thought to be the cause of the disease, but studies have since shown that patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis are not always colonized with Malassezia furfur. The current theory is infection with Dietzia papillomatosis, a gram-positive aerobic actinomycete. Other proposed causes include diabetes, obesity, ultraviolet light exposure, amyloidosis, and overexpression of keratin-16." <br />
"First-line treatment is minocycline. The papules can take 12 to 39 months to resolve. There is a recurrence rate of 13.8% to 15.4%." <br />
"Changes in confluent and reticulated papillomatosis with changing weight and diabetes control support this theory. UV light can induce confluent and reticulated papillomatosis because it has an effect on melanogenesis and can cause transient epidermal hyperplasia. Amyloid deposits have been found in some patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, suggesting amyloidosis as a cause. Familial cases of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis could be due to overexpression of keratin-16." <br />
"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is reported to occur in different geographic areas and regions. It has a higher frequency in Caucasians. The Mayo Clinic conducted a study between 1972 and 2003 with 39 patients diagnosed with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis and determined the mean age of occurrence to be 15 years old with a range of 8 to 32 years and a male predilection of 1.4:1" <br />
"The diagnosis of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is clinical, but a skin biopsy can be performed to rule out other diseases. Findings on histopathology include:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Hyperkeratosis   </li>
<li>Papillomatosis   </li>
<li>Focal acanthosis   </li>
<li>Increased melanin pigmentation and melanosomes"   </li>
</ul>
<p>"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is mostly asymptomatic but can present with some pruritus. The disease is limited to the skin and presents as multiple 5 mm brown to hyperpigmented macules and papules in the center that can coalesce to form plaques with reticulation in the periphery. There can be some velvety or warty changes. The papules have epidermal changes, including scaling, hyperkeratosis, and/or atrophy. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis most commonly occurs on the upper trunk and axilla." <br />
"Davis et al. proposed five criteria for the diagnosis of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.  <br />
1. Clinical findings of scaling brown macules and patches, part of which appear reticulated and papillomatous <br />
2. Involvement of the upper trunk and neck <br />
3. Fungal staining is negative for fungus <br />
4. No response to antifungal treatment <br />
5. Excellent response to minocycline <br />
Jo et al. in 2014 proposed a change to the criteria. <br />
1. Scaly brown macules and patches with some appearing reticulated and papillomatous <br />
2. Involvement of the upper trunk, neck, or flexural areas <br />
3. Negative fungal staining or no response to antifungal treatment <br />
4. Excellent response to antibiotics <br />
Differential diagnoses to consider are acanthosis nigricans, tinea versicolor, Dowling-Degos disease, Galli-Galli disease, dyskeratosis congenita, prurigo pigmentosa, terra firma-forme dermatosis, and Darier disease." <br />
"First-line treatment is oral minocycline. Minocycline 50 mg twice a day for six weeks produces a good response with minimal side effects." <br />
"The use of antifungals is due in large part to the previous theory that Malassezia furfur causes confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. Topical selenium sulfide applied once a day for three weeks and then once a week for another three weeks produced a good response, but this could be due to its keratolytic properties. Other antifungals, such as ketoconazole, tolnaftate, and itraconazole, have worked, but recurrences were common." <br />
"Systemic retinoids, like isotretinoin and etretinate, have shown to be effective, but minocycline and azithromycin are safer and are preferred. Topical therapies such as topical retinoids, urea, calcipotriol, and tacrolimus have been successful." <br />
"Treatment can help with emotional distress and cosmetic appearance. Patients should be advised to keep the skin moisturized and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun."   </p>

"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis usually clears with a <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/tetracycline" class="external-link">tetracycline</a> (minocycline, doxycycline for 6–12 weeks) or a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin, clarithromycin, <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/erythromycin" class="external-link" class="external-link">erythromycin</a> for 4–6 weeks). Azithromycin and <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/erythromycin" class="external-link" class="external-link">erythromycin</a> can be prescribed in <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/safety-of-medicines-taken-during-pregnancy" class="external-link">pregnancy</a>. <br />

"A single course of minocycline or a macrolide antibiotic is reported to lead to remission for up to 2 years in many cases of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. <br />
Spontaneous resolution has been reported in a few cases but it may take up to 39 months for the eruption to clear up."   </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36923260/" class="external-link">Confluent and Reticulated Papillomatosis Successfully Treated with Topical Vitamin A Derivative</a> <br />
"Treatment options of the disease include systemic (such as antibiotics, antifungals, and retinoids) and topical treatments (such as lactic acid, antifungals, retinoids, salicylic acid, urea, tacrolimus, and vitamin D analogs). We report a case of a 17-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, presented with a new onset of asymptomatic, persistent, and slowly progressing brownish skin lesions over the trunk for 6 months. The diagnosis was revised to CARP based on clinical and histopathological examination. Treatment with topical tretinoin 0.025% cream once daily was begun. There was complete resolution of his lesions at the end of 8 weeks of therapy. There has been no relapse at 2 months follow-up. The effectiveness of tretinoin in this patient supports the theory that CARP is a keratinization disorder. Initiating treatment with topical tretinoin when no limitations for its use would be reasonable as it can provide a safer alternative to systemic therapy." ^4f33cb   </p>

"We report 6 cases of CRP alleviated by various antibiotics. The patient described in case 1 is a 16-year-old girl whose disease was alleviated by oral minocycline, 100 mg daily for 8 weeks. Cases 2 and 3 describe an 18-year-old woman and a 17-year-old male adolescent whose disease was reduced by oral <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/fusidic-acid" class="external-link" title="Learn more about fusidic acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">fusidic acid</a>, 1000 mg daily for 4 weeks.

Complete clearing after treatment with antibiotics raises the possibility that CRP is triggered by a bacterial infection and that antibiotics are the treatment of choice for CRP."   </p>

"The bacteria Dietzia Papillomatosis, increased BMI, disordered keratinization and other factors have been associated with the condition. Recent literature indicate that CRP is not triggered by fungal infection. This case series highlights 3 patients with clinically diagnosed CRP, who were treated with a topical 3% clindamycin, 3% sulfur and 3% salicylic acid in aqueous cream mixture along with oral doxycycline 100mg daily for 6 weeks. At the 6 weeks follow up visit, patients demonstrated approximately 90-95% improvement in hyperpigmentation, papules, plaques and scaling. Recurrence occurred within 2 years for all 3 patients, but to a lesser extent than initial presentation and with similar response to repeated treatment."</p></div>
