<p><strong>Description of the startup.</strong>   </p>
<p><strong>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</strong> <br />
I would like to have the product myself.  <br />
It would drastically improve health of the population.  <br />
Cigarettes, vaping products, and nicotine replacement therapy form a 983 billion USD market, thus the market size is huge, enabling a unicorn.  <br />
I believe I have unique knowledge, giving me an unfair business advantage, which allowed me to know how to make this project feasible and which explains why it has not been done yet. <br />
I don't think new technology will take over my current solution in the future. <br />
I think the product is sufficiently superior to what is currently available to be worth buying even if the brand is initially unknown.   </p>
<p><strong>In what ways has your initial idea evolved since you began your startup journey?</strong>   </p>
<h4 id="about-the-product">About the product</h4>

I have had friends as customers who are helped by my product. But more so as a proof of concept and to help them. In the end, to later truly bring the product to the masses, I plan on using digital marketing.    </p>
<p><strong>Have you already raised founds ? How have you planning on doing so?</strong> <br />
No rounds have been raised. I plan on doing so after having a working product to show off and associated patent to protect the idea, or at least a business plan and working MVP with some patent.   </p>

<p>**Name, logo and email of the startup. ** <br />
The name will be: SNICA. SNICA stands for 'smart nicotine alternative'. The logo is not defined yet. The current email address is the one from the founder: tainmontarthur@icloud.com.   </p>
<p><strong>Description of the startup.</strong> <br />
SNICA will provide a healthy alternative to cigarettes, vaping products and nicotine replacement therapy.   </p>
<p><strong>What is your startup going to make? Detailed description of your product from a technical point of view.</strong>  <br />
It will make a stick to hold between lips. The part lying in the mouth will melt to release psychoactive molecules who are transformed to allow fast buccal absorption. Those molecules create similar psychoactive properties as nicotine while being innocuous for the organism. The melting stick will also release other molecules who improve taste, smell and coloration of the product while providing various health benefits, especially for oral health and the microbiome, but ultimately the whole organism, and improving breath, lowering nausea, and improving cognition.    </p>

<p><strong>Can you target to have a prove of concept in some weeks? And, what is the timeline for bringing the final product to market?</strong>  <br />
It would take some weeks to define the exact product specifications. Then it would probably take another couple of weeks to produce the actual product in a lab. After that, another couple of weeks to bring it to market. Thus, in the best scenario, the product could come to market after 6 months.   </p>
<p><strong>Detailed description of your product from a customer point of view. What are you going to offer/which problem does your service solves?</strong>  <br />
SNICA solves the problem of nicotine products being unhealthy and creating bad breath by creating an alternative to improve health and breath. Just not using nicotine is not an option, some people have difficulties quitting nicotine, and some even never feel satisfied again after quitting as nicotine's psychoactive properties helps their neurochemistry. <br />
The psychoactive molecules solve the problems: low mood, high stress, low attention and focus, low social function, low effortful behavior, low cognition, and daytime fatigue; like nicotine would to improve life quality and productivity.  <br />
Other molecules create a pleasurable consumption experience to solve the problem of boredom throughout the day. But also they improve health, especially oral health and the microbiome, but ultimately the whole organism's health, to solve the problem of society's modern lifestyle often being physically unhealthy. Lastly, they improve breath. <br />
Ultimately, SNICA solves the problem of society's modern lifestyle being mentally and physically unhealthy for a lot of people, or that some in general have bad mental/physical health.   </p>
<p><strong>Are products or services in development or existing (and on the market)?</strong> <br />
The product design is in development. But the product is not produced or on the market yet.   </p>
<p><strong>Who are your customers? How are you planning on contacting them?</strong> <br />
Initially, the customers will be nicotine product users. Back when tobacco wasn't considered unhealthy, most adults smoked. Thus eventually, all adult humans, but maybe even adolescents, will be potential customers. Influencer marketing, availability in physical stores, and word of mouth can be used for advertisement.   </p>
<p><strong>Have you already raised rounds? How are you planning on doing so?</strong> <br />
No rounds have been raised. I plan on doing so after having a working product to show off and associated patent to protect the idea, or at least a business plan and working MVP with some patent.   </p>
<h3 id="current-final-project-verdict">Current final project verdict</h3>
<p>The <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">healthy alcohol startup idea</a> has more advantages and is easier to produce than this healthy cigarette idea and thus is better as a first startup. More advantages because it has more health benefits since nicotine itself isn't super bad for health either (while nicotine pouches already exist), but also because it acts on other things than health such as: hangovers, calories/weight-gain, driving under the influence, diabetes... It is easier to produce because the psychoactive molecules just need to be mixed in a drink and don't need transformation for buccal absorption or placement within a stick. ^512a85   </p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-want-to-replace-nicotine-products">Why do we want to replace nicotine products</h3>
<p>We want to replace nicotine because:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Nicotine withdrawal is especially painful due to neuroinflammation.   </li>
<li>Chronic use of nicotine worsens anxiety and depression while chronic l-theanine use improves this.   </li>
<li>Negatively affects oral microbiome and periodontitis and potentially the gut microbiome too (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). The oral microbiome and periodontal health could also impact mental health while oral microbiome dysbiosis is contagious between intimate partners (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Periodontitis and oral microbiome lead to cardiovascular disorder, cancer, Alzheimer? Nicotine can cause bad breath and a bad mouth taste by modulating the oral microbiome. Nicotine on dental carries?   </li>
<li>Nicotine negatively affects sexual-health (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Nicotine can reduce penile girth (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>), and eventually could even contribute to penis shrinkage over time (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). Ginger improves sexual function.   </li>
<li>Nicotine lowers neurogenesis, increases synaptic pruning, and maybe leads to reduced gray matter volume (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).   </li>
<li>Nicotine can negatively affect brain-development (knowing the brain continues development until 25) to increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in later life (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>).    </li>
<li>Nicotine is bad for muscle hypertrophy (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Sarcopenia may be a health issue while ginger prevents muscle loss. It even helps accelerate muscle recovery, reduce muscle pain, and increases glycogen.    </li>
<li>Nicotine-induced lipid peroxidation and mutagenicity is another undesirable side-effect of this compound. What does this mean / lead to?   </li>
<li>Chronic use of nicotine increases sensitivity to pain (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). I believe ginger and l-theanine lower pain. Methylliberine?   </li>
<li>Nicotine could increase cancer risk and cardiovascular issues (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYO0rXyH0lk" class="external-link">1</a>). Ginger and l-theanine lower those risks. Monk fruit and stevia?   </li>
<li>Nicotine can have long-term negative effects on blood vessel health.   </li>
<li>Nicotine endothelial dysfunction? vascular smooth muscle cells dysfunction?   </li>
<li>Nicotine stroke?   </li>
<li>Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, it raises blood pressure. L-theanine, ginger, and chitosan lower blood pressure.   </li>
<li>Nicotine negatively impacts cholesterol. L-theanine, ginger and monk fruit lower hyperlipidemia.   </li>
<li>Nicotine reduces bone mineral density and increases risk of fractures and osteoporosis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger could improve osteoporosis which is prevalent in menopausal women.   </li>
<li>Nicotine increases blood glucose, and risk of type 2 diabetes (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger, chitosan, l-theanine, stevia, and monk fruit lower blood glucose.   </li>
<li>Nicotine increases risk of certain autoimmune conditions?   </li>
<li>Nicotine increases blood brain barrier permeability. The blood brain barrier is a filter for what can attain the brain. Ginger and l-theanine protect the BBB?   </li>
<li>Nicotine sperm quality and epigenetic changes?   </li>
<li>Nicotine replacement therapies are not made with a pleasurable consumption method for continued use, but are made with a hindersome consumption method to eventually stop its use. SNICA uses a pleasurable consumption method.   </li>
<li>Nicotine can increase heart norepinephrine and thus physical anxiety. SNICA would lower this via l-theanine.   </li>
<li>Nicotine increases the risk of infectious diseases?   </li>
<li>Nicotine increases the risk of colds? L-theanine improves immune function to prevent colds. Cold symptoms such as coughing and sore throat are improved by ginger and monk fruit.    </li>
<li>Nicotine can worsen asthma? Ginger improves asthma.   </li>
<li>Nicotine can lead to premature skin aging and worsen a lot of skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, wound healing, acne, atopic dermatitis, hyperpigmentation, telangiectasia (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Nicotine negatively affects skin quality. Ginger can protect the skin as an anti-oxidant. L-theanine too?   </li>
</ul>
<p>We want to replace vaping because:   </p>
<ul>
<li>For the same reasons as why nicotine is bad.   </li>
<li>Vaping causes leaky gut (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger, l-theanine, monk fruit, and chitosan improve this.   </li>
<li>Smoking, but vaping too, can cause endothelial damage which can disrupt every organ (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   </li>
<li>Vaping can cause bad breath.   </li>
<li>Vaping can cause endocrine issues in women (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N68i-YTWDSo" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>). Vaping mutates the genes of cells (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N68i-YTWDSo" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>).   </li>
<li>Could negatively impact bone health (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger could improve osteoporosis which is prevalent in menopausal women.   </li>
<li>Aerosols from vaping can damage the mitochondria of neural stem cells (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger on stem cells? L-theanine and ginger improve mitochondria.   </li>
<li>Lead inhalation is associated with increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and other diseases. Electronic nicotine delivery systems can contribute to the emission of lead in its aerosols (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Metals contained in heating coils and cartridge casings may leach metals such as aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and tin (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Lead exposure in the general population contributes to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, hypertension, renal damage, and issues with cognitive and/or behavioral development. Chitosan, ginger, l-theanine can remove heavy metals from the body.   </li>
<li>Vaping disrupts the oral microbiome negatively (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger, l-theanine, monk fruit, and chitosan improve this.   </li>
<li>Vaping could increase the risk of lung disease, heart disease, and cancer (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   </li>
<li>Could damage DNA and as a result fasten aging (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger and l-theanine could slow down aging. Ginger can protect DNA.   </li>
<li>Could irritate the mouth and airways (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Symptoms such as coughing and sore throat are improved by ginger and monk fruit.    </li>
<li>COPD? Monk fruit in SNICA treats COPD (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).   </li>
<li>neuropathy?    </li>
<li>peripheral vascular disease?    </li>
<li>stroke?   </li>
<li>cognitive decline? Ginger decreases cognitive decline? L-theanine?   </li>
</ul>
<p>We want to replace tobacco:   </p>
<ul>
<li>For obvious health reasons.   </li>
<li>For every pack of cigarettes consumed a day, we can reliably estimate a 14 year reduction in lifespan (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   </li>
<li>Those who smoke are 15-30 times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers. Ginger lowers this risk.   </li>
<li>Dipping increases mouth cancer risk 50 fold. Snuffing greatly increases nasal cancers as well (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   </li>
<li>Smoking increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and smoking cessation is the most important treatment for patients with COPD (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6400424/" class="external-link" class="external-link">3</a>).    </li>
<li>Smoking and dipping increase the risk of periodontal disease. Smoking cessation is necessary in periodontal disease patients.   </li>
<li>Smoking increases the risk of heart disease and cessation is necessary in heart disease patients.   </li>
</ul>
<p>We want to improve the populations' health with SNICA:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Nicotine addiction is prevalent while nicotine is negative for health. The SNICA product is healthy and replaces this addiction. L-theanine prevents nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Wake inducing compounds can prevent smoking relapse (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>), and methylliberine is such a compound. The main psychoactive molecules replacing nicotine are methylliberine and l-theanine while they have a similar time of effect as nicotine. Nicotine blocks 5HT3 and 5HT3 antagonists are a good potential target for smoking cessation strategies (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>), and ginger blocks 5HT3. AMPK activation could be a target for smoking cessation by reducing nicotine withdrawal (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). PPARy activation has been shown to improve nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Ginger increases AMPK and PPARy. L-theanine increases AMPK (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>). Nicotine increases acetylcholine and closes potassium channels to improve cognition and ginger does too. Via l-theanine, SNICA provides additional protection from nicotine addiction by lowering its chronic rewarding properties. Increased butyrate production via the microbiome would lead to increased HDACi. Increased HDACi, when used outside nicotine intake, could fasten the extinction of nicotine addiction (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Also, HDACi can increase memory consolidation to improve cognition, but also improve mood. L-theanine, ginger, and monk fruit could increase butyrate. Ginger could directly suppress HDAC1 (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). Smoking cessation can cause dry mouth, sore throat and coughing. Ginger and monk fruit in SNICA can improve those symptoms. Smoking cessation can lead to nausea, dizziness, and headaches. Ginger in SNICA can improve all those symptoms.   </li>
<li>Nicotine provides a variety of benefits, such as on: low mood, high stress, low attention and focus, low social function, low effortful behavior, low cognition, and daytime fatigue. SNICA would be a healthy alternative to similarly improve life quality and productivity. The act of smoking and vaping can also provide entertainment, while boredom is prevalent. SNICA's consumption method would provide and entertaining action too.   </li>
<li>Cannabis use is on the rise in adolescents. This increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. SNICA, via l-theanine, prevents this risk.   </li>
<li>Sugar addiction is on the rise. Snica replaces unhealthy addictions. Snica lowers sugar cravings via stevia reducing appetite (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>), and replacing sweetness. Monk fruit also replaces sweetness and reduces appetite. I believe ginger also lowers hunger, and l-theanine/methylliberine too by increasing monoamines.   </li>
<li>Nearly half of adults in the United States have some form of gum disease (<a href="https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/gum-disease-by-the-numbers" class="external-link">1</a>). ??Gum disease increases risk of halitosis and loss of teeth, and those are on the rise in general?? People with gum disease have two to three times the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular event (<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gum-disease-and-heart-disease-the-common-thread" class="external-link">2</a>). Recent evidence underscores the potential role of periodontitis as a contributing factor to Alzheimer (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>), and patients with gum disease have a 37% increased risk of mental illness (<a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/gum-disease-mental-health-19819/" class="external-link">4</a>). Gum disease increases cancer risk (<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/gum-disease-linked-to-an-increased-risk-for-cancer" class="external-link">5</a>). Dental cavities (also known as caries or decay) are the most common chronic disease in children (<a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/pediatrics/lend---the-most-common-chronic-disease-of-childhood-in-the-us" class="external-link">6</a>). Multiple compounds (ginger, chitosan, stevia, monk fruit) who are held in the oral cavity during SNICA's consumption prevent gum disease, dental cavities, and halitosis.   </li>
<li>Psychiatric disorders that SNICA can help are on the rise. Addiction is on the rise. Snica replaces unhealthy addictions. ADHD is on the rise. Snica improves ADHD via methylliberine, l-theanine and ginger. Depression and anxiety are on the rise. Snica improves those mainly via l-theanine. Autism is on the rise. ??L-theanine on autism?? Snica could improve it via the lowering of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and increase in serotonin and GABA. Only 1/3 of psychiatric patients are satisfied with their medical treatment. SNICA can help them via its unique mechanisms without undesirable side-effects. For example, methylliberine and l-theanine could improve dopaminergic depression which is resistant to conventional treatments. Methylliberine/ginger/l-theanine could maybe positively affect the overlooked negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Also, l-theanine and ginger could enhance both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis which could improve a lot of treatment resistant psychiatric disorders (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>).   </li>
<li>Snica helps us adapt to our modern lifestyle.   <ul>
<li>A lot of individuals' mental health suffers from our modern lifestyle. Intermittent mood improvements throughout the day occurred in the past from more physical exercise, sunlight, exposure to nature, and socialization. Snica recreates intermittent mood improvements. Chronic stress is prevalent in our modern world and SNICA mitigates this.   </li>
<li>In our modern world a lot of individuals are cognitively maladapted as we need to exert more cognitive effort. Snica improves cognition via ginger (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), and effortful behavior via l-theanine and methylliberine increasing dopamine.    </li>
<li>Our sedentary lifestyle is unhealthy. Snica resolves this by enhancing blood-flow via l-theanine and ginger.    </li>
<li>Our modern diet is often unhealthy. This leads to an unhealthy gut microbiome and intestinal permeability. Ginger, l-theanine, monk fruit, and chitosan improve this. The oral microbiome is also negatively impacted. Ginger, stevia, and monk fruit in SNICA can improve this. We also suffer from high blood glucose levels. Snica improves blood glucose levels via ginger, chitosan, l-theanine, stevia, and monk fruit. A lot of individuals suffer from obesity. Snica improves obesity via l-theanine, ginger, stevia, monk fruit. A lot of individuals are contaminated with heavy metals. Chitosan, ginger, l-theanine can remove heavy metals from the body.   </li>
<li>Snica improves modern society's ubiquitously unbalanced health markers.   <ul>
<li>A lot of individuals suffer from excessive chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. SNICA would treat this via l-theanine, ginger, stevia and monk fruit.    </li>
<li>High blood pressure and hyperlipidemia are on the rise. L-theanine and ginger improve this. Monk fruit improves hyperlipidemia too. Chitosan can improve blood pressure too.   </li>
<li>High homocysteine is a common health issue. Ginger could lower homocysteine.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Major diseases are on the rise, such as: diabetes, heart-disease, cancer, and Alzheimer. Snica can lower the risk from all of those, mainly via l-theanine and ginger. Those compounds have even been shown to increase lifespan.   </li>
<li>Alcohol damages the brain, liver, gut, and microbiome. L-theanine and ginger in SNICA can mitigate the damage on all of those while l-theanine can even fasten alcohol's metabolism. Stevia also lowers liver damage. Lastly, alcohol can perturb adolescent brain development while SNICA could potentially prevent this via ginger and l-theanine's neuroprotective effects.   </li>
<li>Hypothyroidism is on the rise? Similarly as nicotine, the ginger in SNICA improves hypothyroidism.   </li>
<li>Dopamine increasing compounds such as nicotine or SNICA increase the risk of nausea, headaches and slow digestion. Ginger in SNICA improves all those symptoms.   </li>
<li>COPD is on the rise? Monk fruit in SNICA treats COPD (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).   </li>
<li>Arthritis is on the rise? Ginger improves arthritis like nicotine but not smoking.   </li>
<li>Asthma is on the rise? Ginger improves asthma?   </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>[x] Like nicotine we would want to lower neuroinflammation and oxidative-stress. This would be important in counteracting nicotine withdrawal and improve a common health problem in society.   <ul>
<li>L-theanine and ginger can lower neuroinflammation and oxidative-stress. Monk fruit and stevia too.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] The most prevalent problems of human adaptation towards the modern world are: mood (boredom and stress, thus basically lacking positive emotions and experiencing too much negative emotions), effortful behavior, and attention span. Those are improved by nicotine and may explain why it is so popular.    <ul>
<li>Methylliberine and l-theanine will improve mood (positive and negative emotions), effortful behavior, and attention span. Ginger can improve attention too. By improving the gut and/or oral microbiome, ginger, stevia and monk fruit could help improve mood after chronic use. The SNICA object of consumption itself could provide pleasure against boredom.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Improved wakefulness and social-function is also helped by nicotine and desired by the population.   <ul>
<li>Methylliberine would improve wakefulness. Ginger also to some extent. The l-theanine combined with methylliberine would probably improve social function. Ginger would too in some part by improving attention.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] We would want to improve breath and oral health.   <ul>
<li>Ginger, and chitosan could improve oral health and halitosis. Stevia and monk fruit could maybe also improve oral health.    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Nicotine lowers hunger and nicotine withdrawal leads to weight gain.   <ul>
<li>Methylliberine, l-theanine, ginger, stevia could lower hunger by increasing dopamine and serotonin. Stevia and monk fruit can lower hunger while providing anti-obesity benefits. L-theanine and ginger have anti-obesity effects. Chitosan could also positively affect weight, but at used doses in SNICA I am not sure. Stevia and monk fruit can have anti-obesity effects.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Nicotine <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">increases thyroid T3</a> and nicotine withdrawal lowers T3.   <ul>
<li>Ginger improves hypothyroidism.    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Smoking cessation can lead to insomnia.   <ul>
<li>L-theanine can improve sleep. In theory, by blocking MAO-A, ginger could increase melatonin to improve sleep and circadian rhythm. However, l-theanine is combined with methylliberine which increases wakefulness, and at the used doses ginger does not affect MAO-A significantly. Thus, SNICA won't be great on sleep. However, nicotine should like l-theanine/methylliberine increase wakefulness next to relaxation. Thus, if nicotine improves someone's sleep, SNICA providing similar psychoactive effects should too.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Smoking cessation can cause dry mouth, sore throat and cough.   <ul>
<li>Ginger and monk fruit could improve those symptoms.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Smoking cessation can lead to nausea, dizziness, and headaches.   <ul>
<li>Ginger could improve all those symptoms.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Blood sugar rises and crashes are a significant problem. The ketogenic diet is a solution but that few want to follow. Ideally, SNICA would contain compounds that can help stabilize blood sugars.   <ul>
<li>Ginger improves blood glucose and chitosan maybe too. L-theanine could decrease blood glucose absorption. Stevia and monk fruit can improve blood glucose.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] The psychoactive molecules in SNICA increase the risk of nausea, headache, slow digestion. Thus ideally other molecules would lower the risk of those conditions.   <ul>
<li>Ginger can improve nausea, headaches, and slow digestion.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] The medical system is lacking in terms of effective antidepressants or anxiolytics without side-effects, effective ADHD treatments without side-effects, effective treatment for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.   <ul>
<li>L-theanine can provide an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, maybe ginger too. L-theanine, methylliberine, and ginger could improve ADHD. Methylliberine and l-theanine could improve dopaminergic depression which is resistant to conventional treatments. Methylliberine and ginger could maybe positively affect the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Those compounds won't have side-effects and thus be an interesting alternative to conventional treatments. Also, l-theanine and ginger could enhance both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis which could improve a lot of treatment resistant psychiatric disorders.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] People want to obtain reward while increasing effortful behavior, attention/focus, cognition and social function, but also while controlling stress and arousal.   <ul>
<li>Methylliberine and l-theanine will provide this. Ginger can improve cognition and arousal.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Most have high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia.   <ul>
<li>L-theanine lowers blood pressure and cholesterol/triglycerides. Ginger lowers blood pressure and cholesterol/triglycerides. Chitosan may also lower blood pressure. Monk fruit and stevia could also improve this.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Unhealthy microbiome and leaky gut are a common modern health problem that are difficult to treat.   <ul>
<li>Ginger and l-theanine improve the microbiome and intestinal permeability. Chitosan could improve the microbiome and leaky gut too. Monk fruit seems to improve the gut microbiome and by increasing butyrate would also improve leaky gut.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Improve lifespan.   <ul>
<li>Ginger improves lifespan significantly. L-theanine could increase lifespan too.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] High homocysteine is a common health issue.   <ul>
<li>Ginger could lower homocysteine.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Nicotine blocks 5HT3 and 5HT3 antagonists are a good potential target for smoking cessation strategies (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). 5HT3 antagonism could reduce nicotine addiction (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).   <ul>
<li>Ginger blocks 5HT3.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] MAOI in cigarettes could alleviate ADHD and depressive symptoms (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   <ul>
<li>Ginger blocks MAO-A. Ginger improves ADHD and depression. However, at used doses its MAO-A inhibition is minimal. Else, l-theanine and methylliberine improve ADHD and depression either way.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Nicotine can significantly improve wakefulness (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Orexin could prevent smoking relapse (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).   <ul>
<li>Methylliberine improves wakefulness and could very well increase oxexin.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] AMPK pathway is activated following chronic nicotine use but is repressed following nicotine withdrawal. AMPK activation could be a target for smoking cessation by reducing nicotine withdrawal (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). PPARy activation has been shown to improve nicotine withdrawal symptoms.   <ul>
<li>Ginger increases AMPK and PPARy. L-theanine increases AMPK.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Increased butyrate production via the microbiome would lead to increased HDACi. Increased HDACi, when used outside nicotine intake, could fasten the extinction of nicotine addiction (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Also, HDACi can increase memory consolidation to improve cognition, but also improve mood.   <ul>
<li>L-theanine, ginger, and monk fruit could increase butyrate. Ginger could directly suppress HDAC1 (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>).   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Maybe it would be a good idea to increase acetylcholine like nicotine does.   <ul>
<li>Ginger increases acetylcholine via 5HT3 inhibition and direct acetylcholinesterase inhibition.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Fast psychoactive effects to create a head-rush.   <ul>
<li>L-theanine and methylliberine will be modulated for buccal absorption and subsequent fast psychoactive effects.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Sweet taste. Sweet taste reinforces nicotine self-administration (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Thus, sweetness in SNICA could make it more reinforcing to compete with other unhealthy addictions.   <ul>
<li>Stevia and monk fruit should create a sweet taste. Chitosan could hide the bitter taste. Else, extra work may be necessary for taste.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Pleasant unique taste. Creating a unique taste may be beneficial for the creation of an association with the subsequent psychoactive effects, allowing a unique desire for the product and thus addiction to compete with other unhealthy addictions.   <ul>
<li>Stevia and monk fruit would contribute to a pleasant taste by sweetening. Ginger could provide a pleasant and unique taste. Ginger may not be sufficient for a pleasant and unique taste but could be combined with peach taste. Stevia could bring a pleasant mildly cooling or refreshing taste. Inosine 5′-Monophosphate could maybe enhance the umami flavor of l-theanine to create a pleasant unique taste. For a pleasant taste, bitterness from methylliberine can be masked using chitosan, nanoemulsions, or adenosine monophosphate.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Pleasant color.   <ul>
<li>Ginger could create a light brown or yellowish color. However, ginger’s natural color may not be intense enough for vivid coloring of the stick. An orange hue from carrot powder would align with the peach taste but also not be too alienating by aligning with the color of the cigarette tip.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Pleasant smell.   <ul>
<li>Stevia and monk fruit should improve smell. Ginger maybe too. Else, extra work may be necessary.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Hand to mouth action and pleasant lip contact.   <ul>
<li>The stick consumption method provides this. A short stick could both be used between lips or discretely in the mouth as a pouch/lozenge.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Continuous action as a way to occupy oneself.   <ul>
<li>The stick consumption method provides this both if hold between lips or in mouth.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<h5 id="contemplation">Contemplation</h5>
<p><strong>Inulin</strong> <br />
Inulin would be great for microbiome health while being a sweetener. <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Inulin could positively affect halitosis</a>. Maybe it could also positively affect blood-glucose by slowing down digestion. By slowing digestion it could also counteract diarrhea from excess xylitol. <br />
However, inulin becomes like gum when in contact with water. The question is if inulin would be unpleasant by sticking between teeth? I should try it out myself.   </p>
<p>Inulin has a sweetness level of about 10% to 30% that of sucrose.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Doesn't have advantages over other sweeteners. Its sweetness level is too low for the strong bitterness of methylliberine.    </p>
<p><strong>Xylitol</strong> <br />
Xylitol will form the stick that then melts in mouth, while providing a sweet taste. This sweet taste will counteract methylliberine's bitter taste. Xylitol significantly improves oral health and could even treat halitosis due to dry mouth (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).    </p>
<p>Xylitol has other benefits: it increases butyrate production and maybe slightly improves the microbiome composition (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Xylitol could modulate the immune system to reduce infections, it improves bone health, and it increases satiety to reduce hunger and manage weight (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). It can chelate heavy metals (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).   </p>
<p>After smoking cessation, a cough and sore throat develop for the lungs to clean themselves (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking/sore-throat-after-quitting-smoking" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>). Xylitol could improve the sore throat by coating the throat wall (<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-12-home-remedies-sore-throat.html" class="external-link">2</a>). <br />
After smoking cessation, dry mouth may occur (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21587-nicotine-withdrawal" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">3</a>). Xylitol can treat dry mouth (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). <br />
After smoking cessation, constipation may occur (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21587-nicotine-withdrawal" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">3</a>). Xylitol can improve this symptom (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6723878/" class="external-link">4</a>).   </p>
<p>Long-term ingestion of it can increase risk of heart-attack or stroke (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). <br />
It can cause side-effects such as diarrhea, bloating and gas (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/xylitol-101" class="external-link">2</a>).   </p>
<p>Xylitol sticks are sold as weighing 4g.  <br />
Above 40-50g a day, side-effects can start to occur. If spreading use, we may be able to go up to 50g a day. If the healthy upper limit of SNICA is 20 SNICAs, then, each SNICA can contain 2.5g of xylitol. <br />
Else, we need to deduct dose from taste compared to the bitterness of methylliberine while experimenting.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Ginger, stevia, monk fruit, and chitosan could already improve oral health. Xylitol ingestion increases risk of heart-attack or stroke and thus should be avoided. Also, it is not useful as a sweetener due to being limited by the use of low doses to prevent diarrhea, bloating and gas.   </p>
<p><strong>Acacia gum</strong> <br />
While <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">high doses of xylitol could cause diarrhea</a>, acacia gum could treat diarrhea. Aligned with this, it can slow the speed of fermentation of other fibers, to improve gut health via fermentation along the whole colon and to allow higher fiber consumption. <br />
It could slow digestion and thus post-prandial-blood-glucose. It can increase satiety, lower hunger, to manage weight.  <br />
It can improve microbiome dysbiosis and increase butyrate (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). It could reduce GERD. <br />
It can also improve the oral microbiome and as a result plaque and periodontitis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). ^3eacd5   </p>
<p>Acacia gum dissolves in water. Acacia gum doesn't have a taste. But is used in food and beverages primarily for its thickening, emulsifying, and stabilizing properties. Can also be used in food coatings to protect and extend shelf life.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Will potentially be used to prevent the problematic diarrhea side-effect of Xylitol. However, ginger could already counteract that diarrhea side-effect. Thus, acacia gum is not necessarily needed. If diarrhea persists it can be used, or if any of its other unique benefits are needed, such as color, preservation, thickening. However, ginger could also bring color, preservation and thickening. Ginger can also lower blood glucose, improve the microbiome and increase butyrate, lower obesity, improve oral health. It seems like acacia gum doesn't have benefits compared to ginger. Still, if ginger is not sufficient, acacia gum could be added, especially as an edible coating. <br />
However, acacia gum could increase gas and bloating, while xylitol would too. On the other hand ginger lowers bloating via faster gastric emptying. ^95b67d   </p>
<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> <br />
Cinnamon could create a brown color like tobacco, improve taste. <br />
Could improve the microbiome and lower inflammation (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).  <br />
Could improve memory, learning, anxiety, prevent cognitive decline, lower inflammation and oxidative-stress, lower cancer and boost immune system (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Lowers depression and anxiety, cancer, heart-disease and cholesterol (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). <br />
Lowers blood glucose, increases lifespan (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). <br />
Activates PPARy and AMPK (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>), which both can improve nicotine withdrawal (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>).   </p>
<p>Can improve oral health and halitosis, but it could lead to tooth discoloration (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>).   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Does not have unique benefits compared to ginger while it can discolor teeth, thus best avoided.   </p>
<p><strong>Menthol and other anti-nausea molecules</strong> <br />
Menthol is found in mints and different types of mints exist. Peppermint has a 40% menthol concentration while spearmint only of 0.5%.    </p>
<p>Menthol has a cool, refreshing sensation, while ginger brings a warm, spicy kick. Together, they create a contrast of hot and cold that can be invigorating. This combination is often found in herbal teas, throat lozenges, and some candies, where the menthol soothes and refreshes while the ginger adds depth and warmth. <br />
Peppermint has a bold, sharp, and cooling taste with a slight bitterness. <br />
If using them together, it’s best to let one be more dominant—ginger-forward for warmth with a hint of peppermint for freshness works well. Too much peppermint might overpower the ginger’s depth. <br />
Because, peppermint oil demands less processing compared to pure menthol, it is less expensive.   </p>
<p>Peppermint could have unique benefits on soothing mouth feeling, and maybe on improving breath fast depending on how effective ginger can really improve breath.   </p>
<p>Mint could also help with nausea, gastric emptying, gut pain.  <br />
Some research indicates mint could even improve brain function, reducing anxiety while improving wakefulness and alertness. It could improve memory and learning while being neuroprotective.  <br />
Peppermint can also reduce pain. It could also treat headaches while headaches may be a side-effect of the psychoactive molecules. However, topical use is necessary for muscle related tension headaches. <br />
It opens potassium channels thus it may negatively impact cognition, in the end <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">it seems to have a neutral impact on acute cognition and has the potential to prevent cognitive decline</a> by lowering inflammation.   </p>
<p>Menthol may lower dopamine when used alone which is undesirable and make nicotine more addictive when used together which is also undesirable (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Menthol could upregulate nicotinic receptors to make someone more sensitive to nicotine (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Thus menthol may best be avoided. Interestingly menthol could also positively impact smell/taste of tobacco products to increase its consumption (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), which is a reminder towards the importance of smell/taste.   </p>
<p>Here are other natural compounds that can provide similar benefits (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Those other molecules I could contemplate are: ginger, fisetin, capsaicin, thujone, but also boldine by improving health and blocking 5HT3. However, I don't think I need something else than ginger which I already chose as an ingredient.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Menthol and peppermint should be avoided because they can make nicotine more addictive. Other anti-nausea molecules are not interesting knowing how effective ginger is.   </p>
<p><strong>Teeth whitening</strong> <br />
Purple dye may be an interesting ingredient that could whiten teeth. <br />
Purple would indeed be the color of mixing the blue and red pill together. However, using such strong colors could create an artificial and childish appears that could be repulsive to some people. To not be too alienating you may prefer a color similar to tobacco products.  <br />
Also I don't think it will be applied homogeneously to all teeth thus it won't whiten well, on the other hand it could appear on the gums as purple, it could also make surface stains on teeth darker. Lastly, it may be unhealthy to ingest purple dye.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Teeth whitening wouldn't work well with SNICA, and should best be reserved for toothpaste.   </p>
<p><strong>Cardamom</strong> <br />
Cardamom has various health benefits and may be interesting in its ability to treat bad breath and cavities. It could mask bitterness' bad taste.  <br />
However, from personal experience, I suspected Cardamom to negatively impact taste.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Cardamom's breath benefit is already provided by ginger, while its benefits on taste are not convincing.   </p>
<p><strong>Inosine 5′-Monophosphate</strong> <br />
Inosine 5′-Monophosphate can enhance the umami flavor of l-theanine (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bbb/article-abstract/72/11/3015/5941188" class="external-link" class="external-link">|</a>).    </p>
<p>Its potential health benefits: includes increased ATP production, increased creatine in muscle while promoting muscle growth, enhancing antioxidant defenses, and improving liver health.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Could be interesting to improve taste. Could be tested for that.   </p>
<p><strong>Carotenoid</strong> <br />
Carotenoids could provide a tan over time while protecting skin from UV, making people look healthier while they indeed should be healthier when using SNICA. This improved healthy look could be an additional motivation and advertisement to consume SNICA.    </p>
<p>Astaxanthin has been shown to improve longevity and dental health. However, astaxanthin <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">lowers DHT</a> and <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">does not affect skin color</a> at usual supplement doses. Beta-carotene could <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">increase the risk of lung cancer</a> and thus should clearly not be used by SNICA.    </p>
<p>Instead Lycopene may be a good option.  <br />
Lycopene however, has no clear evidence of affecting skin color at supplemental doses even if it could. It has been shown, however, to protect the skin from the sun (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). <br />
Lycopene could create an orange color which is a desirable color for candies and rolled cigarettes and thus would be a desirable color for SNICA. Orange is associated with energy, enthusiasm, fun. The color influences taste perception and is of importance for desirability. <br />
Lycopene can be used as edible coating of the stick to bring food preservation and a consumption method similar to 'Bâtons de réglisse'.   </p>
<p>Lycopene has various health benefits too: strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule with chelating properties, lower cancer, lower heart-disease and improves cholesterol, improves liver health, lower diabetes, improves osteoporosis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), neuroprotective, antidepressant (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>), improve gut microbiome (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>), improves cognitive dysfunction due to a high-fat diet, prevents cognitive dysfunction due to the pollutants phthalate and BPA found in plastics (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>), could increase lifespan (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>), could improve periodontitis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>), could improve obesity (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>).   </p>
<p>Lycopene may worsen stomach and liver damage from alcohol (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). <br />
Lycopene might increase the risk of diarrhea, dyspepsia, gas (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). <br />
Lycopene is not well absorbed without a meal containing fat which could diminish a lot of its health benefits.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Because it could increase damage from alcohol, but also increase risk of diarrhea/dyspepsia/gas, it may best be avoided. Its health advantages are already found in other compounds, while its skin coloration is uncertain. Either way it is only absorbed with a meal.   </p>
<p><strong>Curcumin</strong> <br />
Curcumin, by blocking MAO-A/B could replace the MAOI in cigarettes. Curcumin could also lower 5HT2C which is always desirable.  <br />
Curcumin should have a lot of health benefits.  <br />
It could be used as a food coloring (yellow-red-brown, depending on pH) and thus edible coating. Turmeric is cheaper but the coloring is less. Similarly as its parent herb, turmeric worsens taste via bitterness. Then, other coloring agents may be better such as saffron. Also, both turmeric and curcumin might stain your teeth, saffron would too.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Because it might stain teeth and worsen taste, it should best be avoided. However, I could try if this is really the case in practice. Because, besides that it might be a promising food coloring agent. When I try it, I indeed don't like the taste.   </p>
<p><strong>Xanthan gum and other binders/mucoadhesives</strong> <br />
Xanthan gum is often used as a food additive for its thickening, stabilizing, and emulsifying properties. <br />
Via its stabilizing properties it could bind xylitol, ginger, and L-theanine together, but it may not be the best option for solidifying a "stick" form. Alternatively, consider combining xanthan gum with other binders; acacia gum is often used when binding powders together, pectin can be used if a slightly chewy or firm texture is desired. Pectin is a great heavy metal chelator, and has other benefits such as being a prebiotic to improve microbiome, slowing digestion to create more satiety and lower post prandial blood glucose, it could also lower cholesterol and inflammation, may reduce colon cancer risk, reduce GERD. Pectin has a white to light brown color, and no taste, it can increase shelf-life. Acacia gum, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">contemplated previously</a>, has similar benefits but less as it does not bind to heavy metals and cholesterol, but its different binding ability may be desired.    </p>
<p>Xanthan gum has some mucoadhesive properties, meaning it can adhere to mucosal surfaces like the inside of the mouth, which could potentially help increase the buccal absorption of L-theanine. However, its mucoadhesive strength is moderate compared to other specialized mucoadhesive polymers. Carbopol, HPMC, and chitosan are stronger mucoadhesives. Chitosan could also enhance permeability of active compounds. Pectin has moderate to strong mucoadhesive properties, stronger mucoadhesive properties than xanthan gum but weaker than chitosan or carbopol. Acacia gum has weak to moderate mucoadhesive properties, weaker than pectin. Thus pectin, again, appears superior to Acacia gum.   </p>
<p>Chitosan has strong mucoadhesive properties and can enhance the permeability of drugs across the mucosal membrane by opening tight junctions between epithelial cells in the buccal mucosa, which makes it one of the best polymers for buccal drug delivery.  <br />
Chitosan can also act as a binder.  <br />
If using chitosan both as a binder and mucoadhesive, chatGPT says 100mg would be used in each stick. <br />
Chitosan could also hide the bitter taste from methylliberine. It masks the bitter taste by disturbing the binding site of bitter drugs and bitter receptors in the oral cavity via forming hydrogen bonds (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36364280/" class="external-link">|</a>). <br />
Chitosan can be used as a coating to enhance shelf-life.   </p>
<p>Chitosan health benefits: chitosan may support weight loss and lower cholesterol by eliminating fat and cholesterol from the body instead of allowing the body to absorb them. Its effects on weight seems to be minimal while on cholesterol somewhat effective from a meta-analysis (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/chitosan-supplements" class="external-link">|</a>). It could also lower blood pressure and blood glucose (<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/chitosan-everything-you-need-to-know-7866985" class="external-link">|</a>). Chitosan can improve the gut microbiome, enhance gut barrier integrity, reduces inflammation and improves the immune system (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141813024094443" class="external-link">|</a>). It can reduce diarrhea (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09712119.2018.1531763" class="external-link" class="external-link">|</a>). It can chelate heavy metals (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0144861720311735" class="external-link">|</a>). It can lower inflammation and cancer (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4983/6/1/33" class="external-link">|</a>). <br />
Chitosan is great for oral health: it can effectively inhibit the development of biofilms and the growth of bacteria linked to caries, it can increase the remineralization of enamel caries sites (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10570529" class="external-link">|</a>), it could improve periodontitis via its antimicrobial effects, anti-inflammatory effects, bone regeneration and wound healing effects (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8375799" class="external-link">|</a>), it could improve halitosis (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11531652/" class="external-link">|</a>). Chitosan could treat GERD (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374529303_CHITOSAN_GELS_TO_PREVENT_REFLUX_DISEASE" class="external-link">|</a>), while ginger can increase GERD risk. <br />
However, chitosan may interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, as well as calcium and magnesium. However, in animals it improves growth and health when added to their food at high doses, thus this may not be a significant problem (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09712119.2018.1531763" class="external-link" class="external-link">|</a>). Chitosan may negatively impact smell by having a fishy or pungent odor.   </p>
<p>Salt could negatively impact mucoadhesive properties. Either way, for perceived health reasons, salt should be avoided in product. Chitosan (CS) may only be a mucoadhesive in acidic environments while acidity is best avoided for oral health. Transformed chitosan may overcome this issue, such as trimethylated-CS and thiolated-CS. An increase in the CS permeation enhancing effect was observed with an increase in both its deacetylation degree and molecular mass. Thiolated-CS improves mucoadhesion but also showed a higher permeation enhancer effect compared to regular CS (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/20/5/335" class="external-link">|</a>). It seems to maintain health benefits of regular chitosan, also it could mask bitterness even better says chatGPT. ^cfde0a   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Chitosan would be a great addition for its mucoadhesive, increased mucosal permeability, and binder properties. It could hide the bitter taste from methylliberine, act as a coating and enhance shelf-life. It can reduce diarrhea, and improve health. It could lower GERD from ginger.   </p>
<p><strong>Other ingredients recommended by chatGPT to complete the product</strong> <br />
Mannitol for improved mouth sensation. Xylitol can be gritty and sticky while mannitol is smooth and prevents clumping. It would improve texture and avoid stickiness of the stick. Mannitol will also slow down the melting of xylitol. However, mannitol is less sweet and has less health benefits compared to xylitol. <br />
Mannitol, a sugar alcohol, is a sweetener generally considered safe and doesn't promote tooth decay. But when consumed in large amounts (more than 50 grams a day) it has a laxative effect. It contains 1.6 calories per gram instead of 4 calories per gram for sucrose. It does not increase blood glucose as much as sucrose. Mannitol can reduce weight by transforming white fat into brown fat. Mannitol do not affect the composition of the gut microbiota but it can increase butyrate production.   </p>
<p>Magnesium stearate is a lubricant to prevent ingredients from sticking, it helps mix the ingredients, and it prevents the stick from crumbling. <br />
Magnesium stearate is generally considered safe to consume, but excessive intake can cause a laxative effect.    </p>
<p>Flavor: such as mint, vanilla, or citrus.  <br />
However, I will already have a ginger flavor that needs to be taken in account. Apple or blueberry are tastes that could pair well with ginger. Other tastes are coconut, honey, citrus, pineapple, almond, cinnamon. I could try one or even combine multiple tastes. Vanilla may be interesting to mask bitterness.   </p>
<p>The coloring I use could align with the taste. I should probably use a natural extract for the coloring to maintain the 'natural' aspect of my product.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Maybe I could try those.   </p>
<p><strong>Lion mane and other medicinal mushrooms</strong> <br />
Lion mane could increase acetylcholine and BDNF to improve cognition.  <br />
Various positive effects on general health like cancer, anti-hyperglycemia, hypo-lipidemic properties, anti-inflammatory/oxidation, improves bone density and heart health. <br />
Improves gut microbiome. <br />
It seems to have a good taste.  <br />
It could lower DHT.   </p>
<p>Reishi mushroom may also block DHT while it does not provide interesting benefits either way.   </p>
<p>Cordyceps can improve endurance without the need to perform physical exercise, acting as an exercise mimetic (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). It could improve immune system, liver and kidney health, lower blood sugar, improve energy and libido, reduce cancer (<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/cordyceps-benefits" class="external-link" class="external-link">2</a>), could improve longevity (<a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.599.1" class="external-link">3</a>), and skin aging (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049886/" class="external-link">4</a>). <br />
Cordyceps could cause nausea and diarrhea (<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/cordyceps-benefits" class="external-link" class="external-link">2</a>). Cordyceps is very expensive.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Those molecules don't provide much unique benefits while they can have side-effects and are expensive.   </p>
<p><strong>Fisetin</strong> <br />
Fisetin could improve lifespan as a senolytic which means that it clears senescent cells (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). But it could also enhance lifespan by lowering mTOR, increasing SIRT1, lowering inflammation and oxidative-stress (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). <br />
Fisetin has various health benefits: improving microbiome, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress, anti-cancer, lowering cholesterol, increases neurogenesis, lowering depression via MAO-A inhibition (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>).  <br />
Fisetin could provide a yellow color. <br />
It has no taste or smell. <br />
Fisetin may cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also increase the risk of bleeding from blood thinners (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/fisetin" class="external-link">2</a>). Fisetin could lower testosterone and act as a partial estrogen agonist to lower estrogen when high (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Fisetin's benefits are not unique compared to ginger while it comes with undesirable side-effects.   </p>
<p><strong>Taurine</strong> <br />
Taurine improves longevity, has various health benefits, and improves various aspects of physical exercise performance.  <br />
Taurine has an anti-epileptic effect, reducing neuronal excitation, in part by increasing GABA, which can also lower anxiety. But I fear this can negatively impact certain aspects of cognition and creativity as I experienced myself with certain compounds that lower neuronal excitation. Probably due to this, taurine has lethargy and drowsiness as a side-effect. L-theanine would already treat anxiety and increase GABA, thus this effect from taurine is of no utility.  <br />
Taurine lowers blood pressure and blood glucose. Ginger already does this, thus I fear blood pressure/glucose could fall too low if combining both. <br />
Dr. Huberman, who has a large influence, is against taurine. He says taurine has potential negative effects on the microvasculature, which led to bursting of microvasculature in his sclera.    </p>
<p>Taurine has white color with no taste.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Ginger can improve lifespan already and even have some advantages on physical performance, thus taurine's advantages are not very unique. Taurine would probably have more advantages on physical performance, but SNICA's focus is on replacing nicotine and cigarettes while those never helped physical performance in the first place. Thus, basically, taurine would add cost and complexity for advantages that are not of importance in SNICA. Taurine is also controversial which could fear certain clients away, and even has some potential side-effects I fear, those are additional reasons for not using taurine.   </p>
<p><strong>Avena sativa (Green oat)</strong>  <br />
Avena sativa may bring a lot of cognitive benefits, while slightly lowering stress (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Maybe in part by interacting with potassium channels (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).  <br />
It can block MAO-B, to replace the MAO-B in cigarettes, and increase acetylcholine (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>).  <br />
PDE4 inhibitors could treat obesity by increasing leptin sensitivity, reducing food intake, and increasing energy expenditure (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jes/article/7/Supplement_1/bvad114.008/7290167" class="external-link">16</a>). <br />
It could positively affect skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis via PDE4 inhibition lowering inflammation, also by lowering oxidative-stress it could protect the skin (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).  <br />
Via PDE4 inhibition it could also improve neuroinflammation, asthma, COPD, IBD, arthritis, lupus (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>), allergic rhinitis (<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(01)14511-2/fulltext" class="external-link">15</a>). <br />
Similarly to nicotine, it has the potential to improve negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>). It can also have a neurogenic antidepressant/anxiolytic effect (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">7</a>). Lastly, it has the potential to improve the circadian rhythm via PDE4 inhibition (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">18</a>), which may explain how it improves sleep (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">13</a>). <br />
Common oat (Avena sativa L.), which is matured green oat (Avena sativa), has also been shown to positively impact sperm and bone health (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">8</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">9</a>), to improve blood flow, reduce cholesterol and improve heart health (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">10</a>), to improve diabetes and obesity (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">11</a>), to positively impact the microbiome (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">12</a>). Via its fiber content could reduce diarrhea risk from excess xylitol.  <br />
Avena sativa has even been shown to facilitate smoking cessation at a dose of 900mg/day (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">13</a>). Insomnia is a symptom of smoking cessation (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21587-nicotine-withdrawal" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">14</a>), while avena sativa improved sleep in those stopping smoking (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">13</a>). <br />
After smoking cessation, a cough and sore throat develop for the lungs to clean themselves (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking/sore-throat-after-quitting-smoking" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">16</a>). PDE4 inhibitors can treat chronic cough (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.518345/full" class="external-link">17</a>). <br />
ChatGPT says it has a mild, grassy, and slightly sweet taste. It has green color but usually cannot color food. It is cheap. ^66c0ad   </p>
<p>Oats might lower blood sugar levels and thus interact with diabetes medications.   </p>
<p>If the ideal dose of avena sativa may be 1290mg, then we might want the average 15 SNICAs a day to equal that dose, which would equal 86mg per stick. If the healthy upper limit of SNICA is 20 SNICAs, then this would lead to 1720mg of avena sativa a day which is still close to the proven cognitive improvement at 1600mg and far from the proven lack of benefits at 2400mg (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Ginger's benefits on cognition, MAOI, acetylcholine, to replace nicotine and cigarettes may be limited. Avena Sativa could augment cognitive improvement, MAOI, and acetylcholine, all the while improving various health conditions such as obesity. Similarly to nicotine it could improve negative and cognitive symptoms, including sensory gating deficits, of schizophrenia. It has literally been shown to facilitate smoking cessation, and improve the associated insomnia symptom and maybe cough symptom. It may improve circadian rhythms. <br />
If it is cheap, which seems to be the case, it may be worth it to add this compound. <br />
However, from personal experience, I suspect not liking its psychoactive effects (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). It also seems to have a significant negative impact on taste and smell (<a href="#all-ingredients-on-nicotine-withdrawal-patient" class="anchor-link" class="anchor-link" class="anchor-link">All ingredients on nicotine withdrawal patient</a>). Some studies say its cognitive benefits are not chronic and only present at specific doses (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ginger may be sufficient for cognitive improvement. It may be best to skip Avena Sativa in the end.   </p>
<p><strong>Miracle fruit</strong> <br />
Miracle fruit has a pleasant sweet taste but is special in that it can interact with taste receptors to make bitter and sour taste sweet. It seems more efficacious against sour compared to bitter taste, but still is also effective against bitterness. 300mg of miracle fruit can be used instead of sucrose in lemonade, acting as a good and natural sweetener alternative. Higher doses (600mg) are necessary in bitter beverages such as green tea (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023643818307862" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>). <br />
Unfortunately however, its cost is high (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023643818307862" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>).   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
If it is expensive, while less effective against bitterness, it may not be a good option. I could still try it.   </p>
<p><strong>Stevia</strong> <br />
Stevia is a strong sweetener. It is 150-450 times stronger than sucrose or xylitol. It would improve taste of SNICA against the bitterness from methylliberine.  <br />
It seems to have health benefits: lowered oxidative-stress and inflammation, lowered blood glucose when high, lowered obesity, improved oral health, decreased cancer risk, improved liver and kidney health, potential to improve heart disease markers (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). It seems devoid of health risks: no negative impact on the microbiome, maybe even positive effect on the microbiome (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).  <br />
Stevia could lower diarrhea to counteract xylitol's diarrhea side-effect (<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319837#risks-and-side-effects" class="external-link">3</a>), while it does not cause gastrointestinal issues by itself (<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/stevia-side-effects-6890614" class="external-link">4</a>). <br />
It could also lower appetite (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>). <br />
I think it melts in my mouth and overall provides a pleasant mouth feeling. Also it smells well.   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Could be used if no other sweetener appears superior. Or it could even be combined with other sweeteners. ChatGPT says stevia combines well with monk fruit extract for example.   </p>
<p><strong>Monk fruit</strong> <br />
Monk fruit could be a powerful sweetener (100-250 times stronger than sucrose) to improve taste (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).  <br />
ChatGPT says it pairs well with stevia for several reasons.  <br />
However, this study says monk fruit also has bitter, metallic and chemical side tastes like stevia but to a lesser extent (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Other studies say xylitol is best, and that 25% stevia / 75% monk fruit may be the best ratio to mimic sucrose without any calories (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).    </p>
<p>Monk fruit has several health benefits: decreases inflammation and oxidative-stress, improves blood glucose, could improve cancer, blood lipids, and obesity. It would improve obesity via the same mechanism as the popular ozempic medication, namely via GLP-1 (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). It could also lower appetite (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>). <br />
While stevia is of no significant benefit to the microbiome, monk fruit is (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Monk fruit does not seem bad for teeth, it even has low evidence of improving oral health (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). <br />
Monk fruit could also decrease physical exercise fatigue (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>), decrease histamine allergies, decrease atopic dermatitis and asthma, and regulate the immune system (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>).   </p>
<p>After smoking cessation, a cough and sore throat develop for the lungs to clean themselves (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking/sore-throat-after-quitting-smoking" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>). Monk fruit could treat sore throat and cough (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).  <br />
Smoking increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and smoking cessation is the most important treatment for patients with COPD (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6400424/" class="external-link" class="external-link">3</a>). Monk fruit treats COPD (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).   </p>
<p>Monk fruit does not cause gas, bloating or diarrhea. However, it is more expensive (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/monk-fruit-health-benefits#the-buzz" class="external-link">1</a>).   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Is crucial for improving taste of SNICA. 25% stevia / 75% monk fruit can be used. Monk fruit would improve the microbiome, and the smoking cessation symptoms: sore throat and cough. But it has a lot of other health benefits.    </p>
<p><strong>Licorice</strong> <br />
Licorice extracts are often used as flavoring agents to mask the bitter taste in medicinal preparations. Its active compound glycyrrhizin is 50 times sweeter than sucrose. 60g a day would be the safe upper limit for most, however, its use can still be dangerous for health, while its taste is controversial (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).   </p>
<p>Consensus: <br />
Because it can be dangerous to health at higher doses, while higher doses could be attained via abuse or via concomitant other products containing it, it may be best to avoid it. Also, its taste appears to be controversial.   </p>
<p><strong>Adenosine monophosphate</strong> <br />
Could be used to block bitterness if still necessary.   </p>
<h5 id="decisive">Decisive</h5>
<p><strong>Methylliberine and l-theanine</strong> <br />
Methylliberine and l-theanine combine very well because they have a similar half-life of 1.5h and attain peak plasma after 30-50min, thus they have similar timing. The half-life is similar to nicotine which again makes them great at replacing nicotine.   </p>
<p>Nicotine could be replaced by l-theanine and methylliberine. Methylliberine will increase dopamine, improve wakefulness, effortful behavior, attention, and mood. Similarly nicotine can increase dopamine, improve wakefulness, effortful behavior, attention, and mood. L-theanine can lower stress, anxiety, nervousness, neuroinflammation and oxidative-stress, improve mood, sensory-gating, increase serotonin, GABA, and dopamine, while lowering norepinephrine. Chronic nicotine can also lower stress/anxiety/nervousness, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, improve mood, sensory-gating, increase serotonin, GABA and dopamine. Nicotine lowers norepinephrine in most brain parts but actually increases it in others while l-theanine would lower it everywhere. By increasing norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex nicotine could have a cognitive advantage, but by increasing it peripherally it increases heart rate to increase physical anxiety which would be a disadvantage. However, methylliberine might slightly increase norepinephrine while l-theanine lowers it, thus in the end we would have low-moderate norepinephrine everywhere.    </p>
<p>Else, it is also interesting to note that methylliberine should have a similar mechanism of action as caffeine while caffeine/l-theanine combination have been shown to improve attention and cognition synergistically (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). It is liked in nootropic communities.   </p>
<p>Interestingly, l-theanine could block reward from nicotine to prevent relapse into nicotine addiction. L-theanine could also block THC use during adolescence increasing schizophrenia risk (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">a4b2nAChR, addiction, adolescence-life-stress, l-theanine, nicotine, opioid, reward, THC, withdrawal</a>). L-theanine could fasten alcohol's metabolism while protecting the liver and probably other organs too from it by reducing oxidative-stress and inflammation (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">alcohol, IL1b, IL6, l-theanine, liver, NF-kB, oxidative-stress, TNF-a</a>).   </p>
<p>L-theanine has other benefits. It is neuroprotective. It has anti-tumor effects. Decreases risk of cardiovascular disease. It lowers blood pressure and cholesterol. It has anti-anxiety and anti-depression properties by increasing BDNF (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). L-theanine is liver and kidney protective, improves immune function to prevent colds (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). It lowers cholesterol and triglycerides by improving the microbiome, it enhances the intestinal mucosal barrier, it increases insulin sensitivity, it has anti-obesity effects via the microbiome and by increasing brown fat and by decreasing glucose absorption but increasing protein absorption, it improves fatty liver and insulin sensitivity (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). L-theanine could increase lifespan (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). L-theanine could chelate heavy metals (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>). <br />
L-theanine could enhance both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis which could improve a lot of treatment resistant psychiatric disorders (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>). <br />
L-theanine could activate AMPK (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>), while this pathway has been shown to improve nicotine withdrawal (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">7</a>).   </p>
<p>Methylliberine could increase caffeine's half-life via inhibition of CYP1A2 while smoking induces CYP1A2 to metabolize caffeine faster. Caffeine could increase oral bioavailability of methylliberine (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Thus after initiation of SNICA, individuals may become more sensitive to caffeine. By inhibiting CYP1A2, methylliberine could slow down the metabolism of various drugs.  <br />
By lowering blood pressure, l-theanine could interact with blood pressure lowering medications (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1053/theanine" class="external-link">2</a>).   </p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong> <br />
Nicotine increases glutamate and acetylcholine to improve cognition while l-theanine and methylliberine don't have a significant impact on those. Also l-theanine/methylliberine don't benefit cognition via increased prefrontal norepinephrine like nicotine does. Lastly, nicotine could improve cognition by closing potassium and HCN channels. Thus, l-theanine/methylliberine maybe misses cognitive improvement compared to nicotine. We can add ginger for cognitive improvement. Ginger will block 5HT3 to increase acetylcholine, glutamate and norepinephrine, it will also increase acetylcholine by blocking cholinesterase activity, it also blocks potassium channels, and further lowers neuroinflammation and oxidative-stress to improve cognition. Chronic use of Ginger has even been shown to <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">significantly improve cognition in healthy middle-aged women</a>. It could also improve cognition via <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">NGF and the microbiome</a> while nicotine does not. Nicotine cognitive benefits seem to disappear after chronic use thus they are not that interesting either way. Thus it could even have cognitive advantages over nicotine and allow occasional acute nicotine use for its acute cognitive benefits. <br />
<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Nicotine blocks sodium channels</a> which could help stabilize mood, and <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">tobacco contains lithium</a> which could also stabilize mood. Ginger can block <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">sodium channels</a> to stabilize mood. <br />
Ginger could <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">activate PPARy</a>, while <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">this pathway has been shown to improve nicotine withdrawal</a>. Ginger could <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">activate AMPK</a>, while <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">this pathway has been shown to improve nicotine withdrawal</a>. <br />
Similarly, nicotine blocks 5HT3 and 5HT3 antagonists are a good potential target for smoking cessation strategies (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), 5HT3 antagonism could reduce nicotine addiction (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>), while ginger blocks 5HT3. <br />
Nicotine improves hypothyroid (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>), and ginger too (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>).   </p>
<p>Ginger can lower nausea and headaches and slow gastric emptying while those could be side-effects from the l-theanine/methylliberine. 500mg two times a day may be more than necessary for nausea (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). <br />
Lowers blood glucose, improves cholesterol and triglycerides, improves fatty liver and obesity (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). 2g a day of ginger was found to slightly improve weight loss and metabolic features of obesity (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). <br />
Ginger could accelerate recovery of muscle strength following intense exercise at a higher dose of 4g, reduce muscle pain, increase muscle glycogen to improve performance, prevent muscle loss. It could lower pain in general. It increases mitochondrial biogenesis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). <br />
Ginger can improve the microbiome, increase butyrate, improve intestinal permeability, lower diarrhea (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). However, ginger at high doses could increase GERD and diarrhea risk, but also maybe gastric exfoliation (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">12</a>). <br />
Ginger lowers depression and anxiety. It could block MAO-A (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>), to replace MAOIs in cigarettes (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>), however at used doses maybe not sufficiently. Ginger could enhance both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis which could improve a lot of treatment resistant psychiatric disorders (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">15</a>). <br />
Ginger improves overall oral health, and even improves breath (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">7</a>). <br />
Ginger decreases cancer risk, including lung cancer (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">8</a>).  <br />
Ginger has various health benefits: on colds, arthritis, hypertension (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), asthma (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">10</a>), osteoporosis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">11</a>). It could protect from heavy metals (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">13</a>). It could lower homocysteine (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">14</a>). <br />
Ginger may improve sexual function (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">9</a>). And I guess via 5HT3 antagonism it could reduce the occurrence of blunting in general while using serotonin enhancing agents such as MAO-A inhibitors or l-theanine. <br />
Ginger can improve thyroid (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">15</a>), while nicotine withdrawal leads to hypothyroid (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">16</a>).   </p>
<p>Ginger could protect skin as an anti-oxidant, and increase lifespan by lowering inflammation/oxidative-stress, protecting DNA and telomeres, modulating epigenetic alterations and proteostasis, increasing autophagy and decreasing mTOR, lowering insulin while increasing AMPK and sirtuins, improving mitochondria, being a senolytic, maintaining stem-cells, reduce dysbiosis (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">12</a>).   </p>
<p>Ginger could improve taste and color and smell. ChatGPT says it could help hide the bitter and astringent taste from methylliberine. It can be used for food preservation, and as a thickening agent. <br />
Ginger could also bring preservation and thickening.   </p>
<p>Ginger can lower blood glucose levels and thus interact with diabetes medication. Ginger might slow blood clotting and interact with blood thinners. Ginger can increase the dose of and thus interact with losartan. Ginger can decrease blood pressure and interact with blood pressure lowering medications. Taking ginger, specifically two hours, before taking cyclosporine might increase how much cyclosporine the body absorbs. Ginger can increase how much metronidazole the body absorbs (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-961/ginger" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>). Ginger can increase the blood levels of morphine (<a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/ginger-interact-drugs-3574035/" class="external-link">2</a>).    </p>
<p>After smoking cessation, a cough and sore throat develop for the lungs to clean themselves (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking/sore-throat-after-quitting-smoking" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">1</a>). A bronchodilator would improve the cough symptom. Ginger can act as a bronchodilator (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3604064/" class="external-link">2</a>). Also, ginger can help a sore throat by acting as an anti-inflammatory pain reliever (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ginger-for-sore-throat" class="external-link">3</a>). <br />
After smoking cessation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea can occur (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21587-nicotine-withdrawal" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link" class="external-link">4</a>). Ginger can treat nausea (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>), headaches (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">6</a>), and dizziness (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3537898/" class="external-link">7</a>, <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320492#home-remedies" class="external-link">8</a>).   </p>
<p><strong>Chitosan</strong> <br />
Chitosan would be a binder keeping the stick together.  <br />
It would improve buccal absorption by being a mucoadhesive and increasing mucosal permeability.  <br />
It would hide the bitter taste of methylliberine.  <br />
It can also provide various health benefits: lowering weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, diarrhea, heavy metals, inflammation and cancer, improve the gut microbiome, gut barrier, immune system, caries and periodontitis, halitosis. <br />
It could lower GERD from ginger.   </p>
<p>For buccal drug delivery, it may be best to use <a href="#__cfde0a" class="anchor-link" class="anchor-link">thiolated-chitosan</a> instead of regular chitosan.   </p>
<p>People with shellfish allergy should be cautious of chitosan (<a href="https://www.rxlist.com/chitosan/generic-drug.htm" class="external-link">1</a>). Chitosan might increase the blood-thinning effects of warfarin. Taking chitosan with acyclovir might reduce the amount of acyclovir the body absorbs (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-625/chitosan" class="external-link">2</a>).   </p>
<p><strong>Stevia</strong> <br />
Stevia will be crucial to improve taste of the product, counteracting the bitter taste from methylliberine. It could also improve smell and mouth feeling. Stevia has various health benefits, of interest it could lower blood glucose when high, improve obesity, decrease cancer risk while lowering inflammation and oxidative stress, and improve oral health.   </p>
<p><strong>Monk fruit</strong> <br />
For ideal taste 25% stevia / 75% monk fruit is used. Monk fruit would improve the microbiome, and the smoking cessation symptoms: sore throat and cough. It has a lot of other health benefits, but it is more expensive.   </p>
<h5 id="dosing">Dosing</h5>
<p>ChatGPT says: on average, smokers consume 10-20 cigarettes a day. While vapers consume 20 cigarettes a day worth of nicotine. <br />
Gemini says: on average, smokers consume 13 cigarettes a day. <br />
I think I would like SNICA to be consumed once every hour. If someone sleeps 8 hours, he has 16 hours left awake, maybe he misses one hour at one point which equals 15 SNICAs a day. This number is also close to how much smokers and vapers consume. <br />
Thus, when dosing, I should expect 15 SNICAs to be consumed a day on average.   </p>
<p><strong>Methylliberine and l-theanine</strong> <br />
An equal mix between caffeine and l-theanine to improve cognition consists of 2/2.5 (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). However, others have used with success ratios such as 1.5/2.5 or 1/2 (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). However, caffeine and methylliberine are not completely the same. Maybe, as methylliberine is not anxiogenic compared to caffeine, l-theanine's dose could be lowered. But, this equal dosing does not necessarily mean a psychoactive effect similar or superior to nicotine, either way.    </p>
<p>If methylliberine has a slightly longer half-life, I could make it so that some l-theanine gets absorbed via digestive system for some delayed effects, thus not all the l-theanine would be transformed. L-theanine could then also positively affect the microbiome. <br />
Methylliberine has a half-life of +-84 minutes while l-theanine has a half-life of +-65min.  <br />
When transforming methylliberine and l-theanine for buccal absorption, you could verify that l-theanine's buccal absorption is inferior for some to be absorbed via the gut. Gut absorption of l-theanine will improve the microbiome and create delayed effects to compensate for the shorter half-life. A slightly higher dose of l-theanine will then also be needed. Indeed, l-theanine's buccal absorption seems to be more complicated and thus naturally inferior. ^cba294   </p>
<p>At 600mg l-theanine does not improve sensory gating anymore (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Also, it seems effective in a context of stress/anxiety on cognition which makes it have ambiguous effects on processing-speed and working-memory, thus you maybe don't want to use too high doses leading to too much relaxation (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Thus, avoid going above 200mg of l-theanine in one SNICA.   </p>
<p><a href="#methylliberine-l-theanine-on-myself" class="anchor-link">Methylliberine/l-theanine on myself</a>   </p>
<p>Different dosing can be tried. Experimenting during nicotine withdrawal might reveal the ideal dosing. <br />
I think 200mg l-theanine is a good dose. For methylliberine I am not sure, but I would say a dose between 100-200mg, thus maybe start with 150mg methylliberine.   </p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Ginger</strong> <br />
Chronic use of Ginger has been shown to significantly improve cognition in healthy middle-aged women, already at a dose of 400mg but more so at 800mg (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).  <br />
Ginger at a dose of 1000 mg/d has been shown to improve thyroid function (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). For nausea, ginger once a day at 500mg seems effective (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). <br />
2g a day of ginger was found to slightly improve weight loss and metabolic features of obesity (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). <br />
Ginger could accelerate recovery of muscle strength following intense exercise at a higher dose of 4g (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">5</a>). <br />
1000mg/day of ginger starts to become effective for diarrhea (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">4</a>). <br />
Ginger can cause side-effects: including heartburn, diarrhea, burping, and general stomach discomfort; higher doses of 5 grams daily increases the risk for side effects (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-961/ginger" class="external-link" class="external-link">6</a>). <br />
Higher doses are needed to hope for some MAO-A inhibition and longevity effects (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">7</a>, <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">8</a>). <br />
250mg of ginger could already treat headaches (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">9</a>). <br />
<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">drug-dosing, ginger</a>   </p>
<p>If higher doses provide more benefits, I might want to go up to the upper limit. This would be 4000mg of ginger a day for 20 SNICAs a day, thus 200mg of ginger per SNICA. Someone using the usual 15 SNICAs a day would have 3000mg of ginger. <br />
Now we also need to see how 200mg of ginger per stick affects the taste.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>200mg ginger.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chitosan</strong> <br />
ChatGPT estimates that 120-200mg thiolated chitosan would be used in a 4g stick for mucoadhesion, permeability enhancement, as a binder, and to mask bitterness from 100mg methylliberine.  <br />
A too high dose would create a texture that is too sticky. Maybe I can start with 160mg.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>160mg   </p>

<p><strong>Stevia</strong> <br />

<h4 id="buccal-absorption">Buccal absorption</h4>
<p>L-theanine and methylliberine need to be transformed for fast buccal absorption to mimic nicotine's fast effects.   </p>
<p><a href="#__cba294" class="anchor-link">Don't transform all the l-theanine or make it less buccally absorbable for some to be absorbed via the gut.</a>   </p>
<h5 id="reducing-particle-size">Reducing particle size</h5>
<p>Reducing the particle size of a compound: to increase surface area, enhance dissolution rate, and improve absorption across the buccal mucosa.   </p>
<p>Since micronization is used successfully with caffeine (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), there is reason to believe it could work with methylliberine and l-theanine. <br />
Methylliberine is structurally similar to caffeine; micronization could enable buccal delivery. <br />
L-theanine is different; micronization could help but might not be enough. Mucoadhesive and permeation enhancers could help, encapsulation or pH modifications too.   </p>
<p>Nanonization leads to 1000 times more particle size reduction than micronization. Nanonization allows for more bioavailability and enables cell penetration. Nanonization is more complex with a higher cost.  <br />
Micronization is likely sufficient for methylliberine due to its similarity to caffeine. L-theanine, being hydrophilic and less membrane-permeable, might benefit more from nanonization, but you can still start with micronization plus chitosan to keep it simple. However, if wanting maximal absorption efficiency you can use nanonization if it is not too expensive.   </p>
<h5 id="absorption-enhancers">Absorption enhancers</h5>
<p>Permeation enhancers, penetration enhancers, and mucoadhesive agents exist to enhance absorption.    </p>
<p>Chitosan improves buccal absorption by being a mucoadhesive, permeation enhancer, and penetration enhancer. Chitosan can also mask bitter taste. Chitosan is especially effective for hydrophilic compounds like l-theanine.  <br />
<a href="#__cfde0a" class="anchor-link" class="anchor-link">Thiolated chitosan</a> would be superior for buccal delivery. However, regular chitosan is cheaper, and thus may be used instead if sufficient.    </p>
<h5 id="drug-delivery-system">Drug delivery system</h5>
<p>Different drug delivery systems exist. They carry the drug and help it cross the buccal barrier.   </p>
<p>It seems like nanoemulsion would be the best carrier for methylliberine. However, micronization may be sufficient and cheaper.   </p>
<p>Chitosan nanoparticles would be the best carrier for l-theanine. If it is too expensive, cyclodextrin complexes can be used if they are fast enough. Else, micronization or nanonization may be sufficient and cheaper.   </p>
<p><strong>Nanoparticle</strong> <br />
Encapsulates a drug to help it cross biological barriers such as for buccal delivery. It is complex to manufacture.   </p>
<p>Chitosan nanoparticle could combine the benefits of a nanoparticle carrier and chitosan. You can manipulate the size and surface properties of chitosan nanoparticles to create a controlled release profile, which can be useful for l-theanine to catch up with the slightly longer half-life of methylliberine. <br />
Thiolated-chitosan nanoparticles would be even better. <br />
They are moderately expensive. But they are fast acting.   </p>
<p><strong>Nanoemulsion</strong> <br />
Best for lipophilic drugs to allow fast absorption through the mucosa. It masks the taste. <br />
May be the best for buccal absorption of methylliberine which has moderate lipophilicity.   </p>
<p><strong>Liposomes</strong> <br />
Liposomes are vesicles with one or more phospholipid bilayers, surrounding an aqueous core. <br />
Liposomes are best for hydrophilic drugs when in core and for lipophilic drugs when in bilayer. <br />
Great for mucosal delivery. <br />
It is expensive to manufacture.   </p>
<p>Phospholipids can be used to form liposomes while they could also block bitter taste receptors. <br />
<a href="#__e6e78d" class="anchor-link">MCT oil</a> may also be used to improve phospholipid liposomes. <br />
Phosphatidylcholine is a lipid often used to produce liposomes with various health benefits, decreasing cognitive decline, and increasing acetylcholine.   </p>
<p><strong>Microencapsulation</strong> <br />
Microencapsulation is a technique where a core of drug is surrounded by a microscale coating or matrix. <br />
It masks the taste. It is cheap. But it provides poor mucosal penetration.   </p>
<p><strong>Dendrimers</strong> <br />
Can encapsulate hydrophilic drugs to improve permeability across buccal mucosa. Still experimental for buccal delivery but promising, still some toxicity concerns. <br />
The cost is high.   </p>
<p><strong>Cyclodextrin complexes</strong> <br />
Particularly useful for taste masking and increasing permeability of small hydrophilic molecules. <br />
The cost is low to moderate. But not as effective for rapid delivery.   </p>
<h5 id="ph-modification">pH modification</h5>
<p>A more acidic pH can reduce ionization of molecules to improve permeability.   </p>
<p>A slightly acidic pH (~5–6) would make l-theanine more permeable. On the other hand, methylliberine benefits from a neutral or slightly basic pH (~7–8). <br />
In the end, the ideal pH would be ~6.0–6.5 when taking in account all factors: good permeability for l-theanine, maintained solubility of methylliberine, not irritating in the buccal environment. The average pH in the oral cavity is 6.8 which is close to that ideal. Maybe if we use citrus flavoring we could slightly lower the pH for improved permeability while improving taste. <br />
However, to avoid any controversy, we may not want to risk lowering pH, knowing that acidity damages teeth enamel. However, if using nanoparticles that encapsulate the methylliberine or l-theanine they specifically can be set to a specific pH instead of the whole solution.   </p>
<h5 id="questions">Questions</h5>
<p>How is chitosan combined with l-theanine and methylliberine for faster absorption? <br />
When wanting to combine l-theanine and methylliberine with chitosan you can use different methods. You can encapsulate them in chitosan nanoparticles (which is not as difficult as it sounds), or you can dissolve them in a chitosan film forming base for strip delivery, lastly, to form a powder: you can blend them with chitosan and spray dry them in microparticles.   </p>
<p>Is chitosan enough or do I need thiolated chitosan? <br />
Chitosan alone is already very effective for buccal absorption of both L-theanine and methylliberine, especially when properly formulated. However, thiolated chitosan (thiomers) can offer even faster and more efficient absorption, longer mucoadhesion, and stronger permeation enhancement, but it comes at higher cost and formulation complexity. <br />
Chitosan is probably sufficient for methylliberine, but l-theanine could probably benefit from thiolated chitosan.  <br />
Start with regular chitosan, and if not sufficient, upgrade to thiolated chitosan.   </p>
<p>Would regular chitosan be enough if l-theanine uses particle size reduction such as micronization or nanonization or drug carriers such as cyclodextrin complexes?   <br />
If you combine L-theanine with particle size reduction (micronization or nanonization) and/or cyclodextrin complexation, then regular chitosan is often more than enough to achieve effective buccal absorption.    </p>
<p>When blending chitosan with methylliberine for a spray-dried powder, would the chitosan mask the bitter taste of methylliberine? <br />
Chitosan alone provides some taste masking, but it’s usually not enough to fully block the bitter and lingering taste of methylliberine. <br />
Cyclodextrins complexes can be used to completely mask the taste.   </p>
<p>Compared to cyclodextrins, nanoemulsions may be better for buccal absorption of methylliberine while they would also mask its bitter taste? Alternatively, would micronization of methylliberine also mask its bitterness? <br />
For methylliberine, nanoemulsions are likely more effective than cyclodextrins in enhancing both absorption and palatability. Micronization does not mask taste and could even increase its intensity. Nonoemulsion is superior to micronization for buccal absorption. Chitosan combined with nanoemulsion would be excellent for taste masking and buccal absorption of methylliberine, and thus be the best option.   </p>
<p>Is nanoemulsion expensive compared to micronization in the case of methylliberine? <br />
Micronization is often 3–10x cheaper than producing a stable nanoemulsion at scale. <br />
Thus, it may be best to first try micronization, and if this is not sufficient, then nanoemulsions can be tried.   </p>
<p>For buccal absorption of l-theanine, is it better to combine chitosan with micronization, nanonization, and/or cyclodextrin complexes? Take in account performance and price but not taste. <br />
Chitosan plus micronization is a strong choice for a cost-effective and balanced solution. Chitosan plus cyclodextrin complexes is very effective but slightly more expensive than chitosan plus micronization. Chitosan plus micronization and cyclodextrin complexes would be the most effective but also most expensive. <br />
Chitosan plus micronization is likely your best combination for balancing buccal absorption performance and cost-effectiveness. It’s an affordable option that provides solid performance without unnecessary complexity or cost.   </p>
<p>Right now, I plan on using chitosan plus micronization of methylliberine and l-theanine for their buccal absorption. Is this sufficient or would chitosan nanoparticles as carriers be necessary instead? <br />
Chitosan plus micronization will work well for quick buccal absorption and will likely be sufficient for most applications. It will provide enhanced absorption without the need for more complex carrier systems. <br />
Chitosan nanoparticles enhance buccal absorption in several ways: just like micronization they increase surface area, enhanced mucoadhesion via their small size. However, chitosan nanoparticles are more complex and cost more. It is best for high-performance formulations: for maximal absorption efficiency and the use of controlled release. However, for most buccal absorption purposes, they may be overkill unless you specifically want to extend the duration or enhance penetration across the buccal mucosa. <br />
For standard buccal absorption of L-theanine and methylliberine, chitosan plus micronization should be sufficient unless you need controlled release or enhanced penetration for faster or longer-lasting effects.   </p>
<h5 id="my-conclusions">My conclusions</h5>
<p>Regular chitosan will be used. L-theanine and methylliberine will be micronized.   </p>

<p>Further research via chatGPT on Michail's comment: <br />
With micronization you need a specific and consistent particle size range to optimize dissolution rate, buccal absorption efficiency, and blend uniformity for powders or films. For buccal absorption, sizes in the 1–10 micron range are often targeted.  <br />
Chitosan requires specific loading methods (how is l-theanine/methylliberine incorporated into or onto the chitosan) and compositions for it to work optimally. <br />
If you just micronize and mix things together randomly, you might: get poor mucoadhesion, lose the drug before it’s absorbed, get inconsistent dosing or absorption. That’s why Michail points out that technical formulation work is needed to get a functional buccal product, not just a blend of powders. ^37fcb3   </p>
<h4 id="taste">Taste</h4>
<p>Sweet taste increases nicotine self-administration (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Thus, sweetness in SNICA could make it more reinforcing to compete with other nicotine ingestion methods. <br />
Sweetness will be found in the used artificial sweeteners.   </p>
<p>Methylliberine is said to have a bitter and astringent taste.  <br />
ChatGPT says bitterness can be counterbalanced via sweeteners, a pinch of salt can enhance sweetness but also reduce bitterness in a direct way (however a lot of people fear salt for health and also salt could reduce mucoadhesion), acidity such as from lemon juice can reduce bitterness (however acidity could damage the teeth enamel over time and thus should be avoided in SNICA), dairy fats can also lower bitterness, strong flavors as from cinnamon, mint or cardamom can mask bitterness.   </p>
<p>People like to transform their coffee in a sugary drink as with Starbucks, people may also like to transform their cigarette in a sugary stick as with SNICA. I should go to Starbucks Coffee and see how the most popular drinks taste like. <br />
The most popular drinks seem to be 'Iced white mocha' (our signature espresso meets white chocolate sauce, milk and ice, and then is finished off with sweetened whipped cream to create this supreme white chocolate delight) with 'vanilla sweet cream' and 'light caramel sauce'. Or the 'Strawberry acai refresher' (sweet strawberry flavors accented by passionfruit and açaí notes, shaken with ice and real strawberry pieces, a welcoming sweet spot of refreshment) with 'raspberry syrup'.   <br />
First, we can note that Starbucks always uses ice to create a refreshing cooling sensation. Afterwards they use sweet, dairy, or strong flavors such as vanilla, to counterbalance the bitterness from coffee. When not using coffee, but green coffee extract (earthy, acid and tart flavor), they combine it with sweet fruity flavors to counterbalance any earthy notes, and provide tropical tartness that complements the acidity. <br />
Maybe look at what vaping taste is the most popular. The most popular vaping tastes have a refreshing and fruity mouth sensation.  <br />
Icy, refreshing sensations, come forward often. Erithrytol provides a strong cooling sensation but has health risks. Stevia could bring a mild cooling sensation. <br />
In SNICA: Stevia can provide a mildly cooling or refreshing sensation. Instead of coffee or green coffee extract we use methylliberine which has a bitter and astringent taste. ChatGPT says both ginger and artificial sweeteners could help mask the bitterness and astringency. Adding blueberry, peach, vanilla, or green apple tastes alone or combined could further reduce bitterness, complement ginger, and create a fruity flavor.   </p>
<p>Creating a unique taste may be beneficial for the creation of an association with the subsequent psychoactive effects, allowing a unique desire for the product and thus addiction to compete with other unhealthy addictions. <br />
Ginger and methylliberine would already provide a unique taste. Peach could further augment that unique taste.   </p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that l-theanine has an umami flavor which can be enhanced by using 'Inosine 5′-Monophosphate'. Such an umami flavor can mask the bitterness of methylliberine while adding depth.   </p>
<p>Lastly, chitosan could hide the bitter taste of methylliberine. This would make things easier. <br />
Using nanoemulsions instead of micronization when transforming methylliberine for buccal absorption could mask the bitter taste even more than chitosan. Or, instead the addition of adenosine monophosphate could block bitterness.   </p>
<p>To improve taste, I am contemplating: monk fruit, stevia, adenosine monophosphate, Inosine 5′-Monophosphate, vanilla/peach/blueberry/green-apple tastes with peach having the advantage of being liked by anyone while being unique. <br />
Citrus could be useful to lower bitterness via acidity. Vanilla could be useful to lower bitterness similarly as dairy fats. ChatGPT says citrus, vanilla, and ginger combine well for taste. Peach could further create a cozy, mellow, fruity taste. <br />
However, if lowering pH with citrus we should make sure the pH does not lower too much to damage teeth enamel. To avoid any controversy, it may be best to skip the citrus.   </p>
<p>I believe that the product could be considered more 'cool' or 'manly' if the taste is spicy and/or bitter to some extent. However, such a taste could push certain clients away. Thus, not sure what would be the most desirable.   </p>
<p><strong>Experimenting with taste</strong>   </p>
<p>Trying to hide methylliberine's taste without l-theanine:   </p>
<ul>
<li>I consumed 100mg methylliberine with 200mg cinnamon. I didn't taste the cinnamon but I still did taste the methylliberine but maybe to a lesser extent. I guess I need to increase the cinnamon dosage further.    </li>
<li>I used cinnamon and cardamon together with the methylliberine and it partly hides the taste of methylliberine but not sufficiently.    </li>
<li>I used stevia with methylliberine and it helped more in hiding the taste of methylliberine.   </li>
<li>I consumed 100mg methylliberine with 2 grams of stevia and some salt. The bad taste of methylliberine was significantly reduced but not completely eliminated yet.   </li>
<li>I consumed 100mg methylliberine with 2 grams of stevia and 100mg salt, but also 200mg cinnamon, I mixed in water. The taste was significantly better but still not particularly tasty. I could maybe add more salt.   </li>
<li>I consumed 100mg methylliberine with 2 grams of stevia and 100mg salt, but also 200mg cinnamon and 200mg of cardamon, I mixed in water. The taste was significantly better but still not particularly tasty. I could maybe add more salt. I am not sure if the cardamon improves the taste. I should test the difference. Either way dosages could still be modulated to improve taste.   </li>
<li>I consumed 100mg methylliberine with 2 grams of stevia and 200mg salt, but also 400mg cinnamon, I mixed in water. The taste was largely improved but still not to the point of it being pleasant. The increased cinnamon instead of 50/50 with Cardamon was way better I believe. Surprisingly I could still not significantly taste the cinnamon, thus maybe I could increase the cinnamon dose even further.   </li>
<li>I combined 100mg methylliberine with 2 grams of Xylitol and 200mg salt, but also 400mg cinnamon and 130mg of mint flavor powder, I mixed in water. The taste was not great. It for sure lacked sweetness, meaning the dose of Xylitol could be doubled next time. Else, the mint flavor was too high I would say. But maybe next I would recommend to only experiment with the Xylitol and only once Xylitol is right try the mint flavor.   </li>
<li>I combined 100mg methylliberine with 6.8 grams of Xylitol and 200mg salt, I mixed with water. The taste was significantly improved but still not good. Sweetness is still lacking I would say or other compounds should be added. ChatGPT says stevia is 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar while Xylitol is as sweet as sugar which would mean that the xylitol dose should be way higher as I noticed too.   </li>
<li>I combined 100mg methylliberine with 10 grams of Xylitol and the bad taste was significantly reduced. Maybe I could even go to 15 grams of Xylitol, after I can add salt.   </li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to take in account l-theanine's taste. Interestingly, it could provide an Umami taste. This Umami taste can be <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bbb/article-abstract/72/11/3015/5941188" class="external-link" class="external-link">enhanced by Inosine 5′-Monophosphate</a>. One feature of umami is the suppression of bitterness (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X14021561" class="external-link">|</a>). Umami is more of a helper flavor, enhancing the saltiness or sweetness of other foods (<a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/umami-fifth-taste/" class="external-link">|</a>). ChatGPT says it is both a desirable taste in its own right and indeed also a sweetness/saltiness enhancer. This means an Umami taste may give its best results when combined with salt and sweetness. <br />
L-theanine could diminish the taste of bitterness (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/sleep-newzzz/201708/what-you-need-know-about-l-theanine" class="external-link">|</a>). L-theanine can lower sourness but not bitterness (<a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/fstr/16/5/16_5_487/_pdf" class="external-link">|</a>). L-theanine is a unique taste component with caramel flavor, which can alleviate the bitterness of caffeine (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9014247/" class="external-link">|</a>).    </p>
<p>Experiment with l-theanine's taste (and the addition of Inosine 5′-Monophosphate):   </p>
<ul>
<li>L-theanine on its own doesn't have much taste but is rather pleasant.   </li>
<li>I consumed 200mg of methylliberine with 400mg of l-theanine, 2 grams of stevia, 200mg salt, 200mg cinnamon, and 200mg cardamon, I mixed with water. The taste was improved but far from enough. As methylliberine's dose got increased I maybe had to increase the dose of the taste-modulators too. Also, I think it is interesting to note that I suspect cardamon to maybe worsen the taste.   </li>
</ul>
<p>I further experiment with taste: <a href="#all-ingredients-on-nicotine-withdrawal-patient" class="anchor-link" class="anchor-link" class="anchor-link">All ingredients on nicotine withdrawal patient</a>.   </p>
<h4 id="color">Color</h4>
<p>Ginger is the only base ingredient that could provide coloration. ChatGPT says it can create a light brown or yellowish color. However, ginger’s natural color may not be intense enough for vivid coloring of the stick.  <br />
If I want a mild and natural hue, then ginger may suffice. I should try and see.   </p>
<p>If wanting to create a blue, red, and purple stick, as an analogy to the matrix. Then this would be the purple stick. Blue would be a purely relaxing stick and red a purely stimulating stick. However, to start we will only launch one stick that replaces nicotine. The start is the most difficult part, and to increase its chance of success we should prioritize that product over aligning with long-term product goals. Thus, right now I would not use purple, unless it is a good color for the product. Purple could be good at representing the mix of relaxing and stimulating psychoactive properties.   </p>
<p>Using strong colors could create an artificial and childish appearance that could be repulsive to some people. To not be too alienating you may prefer a color similar to tobacco products. This could be brown or orange. Orange is associated with energy, enthusiasm, fun. Brown is associated with earthiness, stability, comfort, security.  <br />
However, a tobacco color for a subsequent non-tobacco taste will be confusing. The color should maybe align with taste while staying discrete.     </p>
<p>The coloring I use could align with the taste because colors influence taste perception and are of importance for subsequent desirability. I should probably use a natural extract for the coloring to maintain the 'natural' aspect of my product. An orange hue from carrot powder would align with the peach taste but also not be too alienating by aligning with the color of the cigarette tip.   </p>
<h4 id="consumption-object">Consumption object</h4>
<h5 id="contemplation_1">Contemplation</h5>
<p>One reason smoking is pleasant is due to the cigarette touching a sensitive body part, namely the lips. <br />
One way to simulate this may be to create a stick that melts in mouth. The consumer would have part of the stick in mouth and other part outside of mouth. The inside part melts, and the consumer needs to reposition the stick to keep consuming it. This would maintain the pleasant lip sensation and slight effort/action for consumption which makes it more pleasant via association of slight effort/action with reward. The action is important because like stimming, an action can relax when nervous or occupy when bored.  <br />
Also this stick could be a great marketing move as it will be visible to others, thus users would automatically advertise it.  <br />
The stick could be put in mouth like a cigarette but also broken down in mouth like a tobacco pouch.  <br />
Another advantage is similarity with an actual cigarette to avoid too much alienation. <br />
If mimicking this lip pleasure is not possible, it may be replaced by another pleasure.   </p>
<p>Sensory cues of cigarette smoking in the absence of pharmacological doses of nicotine have been found to be moderately satisfying, to reduce craving and anxiety (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1946567/" class="external-link">1</a>). Sensory aspects of cigarette smoke play a role in the maintenance of smoking behavior, and may be particularly important for highly-dependent smokers (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11935482_Individual_differences_in_smoking_reward_from_de-nicotinized_cigarettes" class="external-link">2</a>). This explains why certain smokers don't succeed with traditional treatments but do succeed with e-cigarettes. With e-cigarettes they enjoy the vapor sensation in their throat, lungs, nose, and on their tongue. But they also enjoy tasting, smelling and seeing the vapor, next to touching the device (<a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-020-00420-0" class="external-link" class="external-link">3</a>).  <br />
This means sensory cues similar to smoking or vaping would help with the transition to SNICA. I could create similar desirable sensory cues as smoking and vaping via a stick format. But also a cooling mouth feeling, good taste and smell. <br />
On the other hand, both gum and lozenges have been shown to help smoking cessation. No significant difference exists between gums and lozenges in terms of efficacy. A cooling mouth sensation and aromas can distract from the desire to consume a cigarette (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373456831_The_Effectiveness_of_Gum_and_Mint_Candy_in_Quitting_Smoking_in_Adolescents" class="external-link">4</a>). This confirms that a cooling mouth feeling, good taste, and smell would also help smoking cessation. <br />
Even if you give nicotine replacement to teens, they still miss the associated oral habit. Some teens say chewing gum can help replace this, or chewing on a toothpick (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To conclude, both gum/lozenge or stick format could work, but the stick format could be superior due to the pleasant associated lip sensation and similarity to smoking/vaping.  <br />
Besides that, a cooling mouth feeling, good taste, and smell are also important.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As pouches are illegal in different countries and less flexible in dosing, they are not ideal. <br />
Strips would be the simple method to allow fast buccal absorption. However, strips lack an action while consuming, and pleasant lip contact. The consumption method of strips is too boring. <br />
Gum will lead to chewing which could potentially benefit jaw development in children, improve stress and attention and digestion (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>), but on the other hand could increase risk of TMJ, especially if SNICA is consumed throughout the day. It is best to avoid chewing across the day (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). Thus, gums may best be avoided. <br />
A lozenge could melt in mouth, or be cracked in mouth to release its molecules and taste like <a href="https://lucy.co/products/breakersf?variant=43365669241018&amp;selling_plan=711622842" class="external-link">breakers</a>. Both gum and lozenge may be slow in releasing its psychoactive molecules, while fast effects are desired and possible with the breakers, all the while breakers are associated with some action and thus are not completely passive. <br />
The breaker would work like this: the encapsulation made of 'gum arabic' partly melts and is partly bitten open by the user, sweeteners are released for good taste together with the psychoactive molecules. Once the user feels like he has had the desired psychoactive effects via buccal absorption, he/she can swallow.  <br />
If using breakers, you may want the released taste of the breaker to be a surprise. Humans love surprises (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). The stick format could in theory also use this surprise taste concept.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breakers may be superior to gums/lozenges/pouches/strips. They provide fast psychoactive effects and a pleasant action. <br />
In comparison, a stick could provide continuous action to occupy oneself while socializing or bored, pleasant lip contact, and visibility for style/marketing. But a stick may be slower to release its psychoactive molecules. Also, in practice, a stick may be difficult to use. However, if desired, someone could use the stick as a pouch for quick psychoactive effects. <br />
Letting the breakers have a surprise taste, could also create some excitement and thus marketing around the product, but also some action when bored or conversation subject when socializing. The stick format could in theory also use this surprise taste concept.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note that slow release of psychoactive drugs tend to bring better cognitive benefit (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). This is because peaks can lead to excessive effects and outside of the peak effects may be not sufficient. This indicates that l-theanine and methylliberine may best be absorbed in part buccally and in part via digestion to simulate a slow release formulation. The user can keep the solution in mouth until he feels sufficient effects to then ingest the rest which will be released later. However, the buccal absorption should create a fast initial rewarding peak. Fast dopamine increases, achieved over a short time period (&lt;10 min), are associated with reward (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>).    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user can keep the solution in mouth until he feels sufficient effects to then ingest what remains which will take effect later. This oral absorption will provide more stable effects over time and also positively impact the microbiome. <br />
The stick format may make this more difficult, because you would have to keep what has melted in your mouth, and thus not swallow during the whole prolonged stick consumption. Alternatively, you can let the user swallow between each stick part consumption (and thus before experiencing the full effects) but after letting what has melted stay in mouth for a moment. If the buccal absorption works well and is fast, this could be possible. It would even have the advantage of better dose monitoring by letting it rise step by step instead of all at once.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would it be possible to make SNICA release a lot of vapor when broken in mouth? This would mimic the pleasant sensory cues of smoking as desired (<a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-020-00420-0" class="external-link" class="external-link">3</a>). It would also have a marketing effect. <br />
'Dragon breath' is a candy that releases vapor. It is made from cereal dipped in liquid nitrogen. But it can be dangerous by causing burns in the mouth or breathing difficulties. The FDA said injuries could in certain cases be life threatening. Also it is dipped in liquid nitrogen shortly before serving. <br />
Besides that it does not seem possible.   </p>
<p>Friend's advice (who himself has smoked, now vapes, but wants to stop): says a stick that directly melts in mouth may be too passive and licking it would be ridicule like a lollipop for kids. Instead, a stick like a 'bâtons de réglisse' could be used, who has a hard outer shell that needs some mild chewing to release the liquid inside. Thus, a stick that needs some chewing for release.  <br />
However, after trying, the problem with that is that the consumption demands too much effort, it leaves a hard part you cannot ingest, and is very slow to consume. A solution may be to make the chewable part consumable. But then we are just making a consumable gum stick, whereby you bite a piece of gum from the stick that you end up ingesting. We already rejected the gum format, and it being in a stick format would just make it impractical. On the other hand we can work on the initial statement which may be wrong. If the stick melts directly, no licking is needed/possible. The melted solution needs to be kept in mouth for a moment before swallowing and the stick needs to be repositioned or kept between lips which creates action.   </p>
<p>I used a candy stick, which is not hard but supple. Still, you need to bite significantly. This made its use annoying and also creates the reflex of wanting to swallow afterwards. The very sweet taste maybe also contributes to the desire to swallow. I should avoid a product that is too sweet or needs too much biting action. Placing the stick between lips, waiting for it to melt, holding what melted in the mouth, repositioning the stick between lips, may already be sufficient actions.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SNICA won't be able to release vapor during consumption.  <br />
A chewable stick is not a good option. The stick should quickly break down and melt in the mouth. It should not be too sweet tasting.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Products are best easy to use (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). Ideally, some familiarity should exist with its use whereby we can associate it with something else. Thus, it should not be too alienating (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">2</a>). By making it look like an actual cigarette, you will also prevent social deviance (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">3</a>). <br />
Both the stick and breaker options are easy to use, familiar to people as everybody has used medicines that melt in the mouth and need to be kept there, and they don't create social deviance.   </p>
<p>Nicotine is reinforcing via its associated fast dopamine increase. But also via its oral habit and lip sensation. The functional benefits from nicotine can also be reinforcing. Thus SNICA should elevate dopamine fast, bring functional benefits such as improved attention and effortful behavior, but also recreate a similar oral habit and lip sensation or some other form of direct oral pleasure (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>).  <br />
The stick would simulate the oral habit of smoking, but the breaker would provide an alternative pleasure that may suffice or be better even.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both the stick and breaker align with the mentioned product needs.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On reddit, people seem to crave the continuous action of smoking, and the hand to mouth action specifically (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1jwraiq/smoking_in_the_car_is_my_biggest_challenge/" class="external-link">1</a>). Some even say they miss the action of smoking more than the high (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1jsxaa2/anyone_else_miss_the_act_of_smoking_more_than_the/" class="external-link">2</a>). Others were able to quit nicotine but still can't stop the oral habit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1jwkghz/how_do_i_quit_the_habit/" class="external-link">3</a>).  <br />
Momo the friend of my brother, says he smokes for the continuous action while socializing. My neighbor Sabine who has smoked also says she prefers a continuous hand to mouth action, and thus she prefers the stick format without hesitation. Maximilien also prefers the stick as he desires the continues action. But others, often those that don't smoke, tend to say they would prefer a mouth lozenge that is more discrete.   </p>
<h5 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h5>
<p>Both the stick format or breaker format could be great. I could try both to see which one is preferred. If I need to start with one, it would be the stick format.   </p>
<p>To actually create the stick or breaker I could use a consultation via upwork. On upwork, <a href="#consultation-with-experts" class="anchor-link">Consultation with experts</a> could be interesting later on for the consumption method.  <br />
However, in the end, I probably need to work with a <a href="#production" class="anchor-link">Production</a> that would provide that knowledge while conceiving.   </p>
<p>Later I realized that a short stick may give the best of both worlds. A short stick could still be placed between lips to provide a mouth action if desired, or be put in mouth as a breaker if preferred for discreteness, plus a shorter stick would release its molecules faster.   </p>

<p>Context: <br />
Elias is vaping since 2 years with 18mg strength nicotine salt. Starting at wake-up time with coffee, continued use throughout the day, until bedtime.   </p>
<p>FIRST DOSE: 12g of xylitol with 200mg ginger, 70mg green oat, 160mg chitosan, l-theanine 200mg, methylliberine 150-200mg.  <br />
FEEDBACK: psychoactive effects -&gt; A positive psychoactive effect is felt. Reduced stress while increased dopamine. Replaces psychoactive effects from vaping well. With nicotine replacement you still get some withdrawal and difficulties while here you do not, thus this is preferred. <br />
FEEDBACK: taste -&gt; 12g of xylitol with 200mg ginger, 70mg green oat, 160mg chitosan, l-theanine 200mg, methylliberine 150-200mg. Taste was very bad, very bitter due to the methylliberine. Green oat has a cécémel taste, especially mixed with ginger it tastes bad. Xylitol does not help sufficiently, even when used at higher doses. However, addition of stevia helps the bitter taste a lot, and in general it creates a positive taste. <br />
FEEDBACK: smell -&gt; The green oat together with the ginger creates a bad cécémel smell. Stevia maybe helps. <br />
FEEDBACK: consumption method -&gt; Prefers a lozenge over a gum, because gum is more cumbersome while lozenge is more efficacious. A stick is cool for the gesture, it is a plus. <br />
FEEDBACK: side-effects -&gt; Maybe feels the slow-down effects of l-theanine which can be pleasant but maybe does not help work. We will see how this evolves.   </p>
<p>SECOND DOSE: 10g of xylitol with 2.25g of stevia, 200mg ginger, 70mg green oat, l-theanine 200mg, methylliberine 200mg.  <br />
FEEDBACK: psychoactive effects -&gt; Feeling good and very relaxed. Maybe too relaxed, but he says that he is sensitive to downers. Thus, for the average person 200mg l-theanine may be good even if for him a slightly lower dose could be better. <br />
FEEDBACK: taste -&gt; The taste is better with stevia. <br />
FEEDBACK: smell -&gt; Smell has not changed with stevia. <br />
FEEDBACK: consumption method -&gt; Even if in theory he prefers the lozenge. In practice he goes for the gum over the lozenge or 'bâton de réglisse'. Once wanting to vape, or feeling like SNICA's effects lower, he goes for the gum. <br />
FEEDBACK: side-effects -&gt; Too much xylitol leading to gastrointestinal discomfort.   </p>
<p>THIRD DOSE: 200mg ginger, 70mg green oat, l-theanine 200mg, methylliberine 200mg. <br />
FEEDBACK: psychoactive effects -&gt; The psychoactive effects are still good. Like nicotine, after 2 hours they start to subside. <br />
FEEDBACK: taste -&gt; The taste is bad as if it makes you want to throw up due to high bitterness from methylliberine without sweetness. Chitosan on tongue beforehand helped a little bit to lower the bitterness but the taste is still bad. <br />
FEEDBACK: smell -&gt; No change in bad cécémel smell. <br />
FEEDBACK: consumption method -&gt; The used lozenge is too hard. <br />
FEEDBACK: side-effects -&gt; Nothing to note.   </p>
<p>First day conclusions: <br />
Great psychoactive effects to counteract the nicotine withdrawal and even feel good. Relaxing effects were maybe a little too strong, but this individual is susceptible to that. Also, he did not necessarily complain of it, and after ginger/green-oat accumulate this should improve.  <br />
He said positive things like: "this is a cheatcode", "I am sold", "seems too good to be true", "if I had known, I would have started this instead of vaping", "feels a little like kratom". As a final proof of concept, he even paid $70 for 8 days of supply which is completely overpriced for a product that is not even finished. <br />
On the other hand, the taste was very bad and needs work.   </p>
<p>Later conclusions: <br />
While trying to stop smoking, Elias misses the pleasure of fast incoming effects (head rush) when using the MVP. This is why he also uses the nicotine spray. He says it would be great if I can recreate the head rush with my product. Thus, the complete product with fast buccal absorption is mandatory. <br />
He also says he enjoys the habits of vaping, such as going outside, which would be an argument for the stick format to simulate vaping/smoking as much as possible.   </p>
<p>In retrospection, I want to note that Maximilien said the same, the pleasurable action of smoking and fast-coming effects are mandatory.   </p>
