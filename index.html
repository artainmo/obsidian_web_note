      <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>In EU, certain chemical suppliers exist who supply tipepidine for research purposes. However, pharmacies cannot legally compound research-graded drugs. Also, research-graded means the drug may contain toxic impurities or bacterial contamination. <br />
Pharmacies need to import GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) grade tipepidine. MedicaPharma can supply this. MedicaPharma is located in the Netherlands and offers worldwide shipping. Some international options exist (PharmaCompass, Yungjin Pharm, Taiwantrade, Pharmaffiliates) but import requires national approval.  <br />
I asked <em>MedicaPharma</em> (located in the Netherlands) a quote for 42g tipepidine which allows use of 120mg a day for one year. I also asked a quote to a Taiwan provider from <em>PharmaCompass</em> but without success. <br />
MedicaPharma answered me that 50g tipepidine would cost €5870. If using 120mg a day, this would equal €425/month. As bulk orders cost less, buying 1kg at once would cost €137/month. Negotiation is also always possible to lower the price. However, I cannot buy such huge bulk orders right now either way. <br />
In the UK, at <a href="https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~14438" class="external-link">Cambridge Bioscience</a>, I found 25g of tipepidine at €182. This is a great price, better than <em><a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Asverin</a></em> in Japan. For 120mg a day, it would cost €26 a month. The molecules are probably research-graded but they say it is good quality. However, Cambridge Bioscience only delivers in the UK. Their supplier is <em>FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals</em>. I contacted them for tipepidine in Belgium, and I also sent a mail to their Belgian distributor <em>sopachem</em>. I guess I will need to wait for a response. If it fails, I guess I can always contact <a href="https://labchem-wako.fujifilm.com/europe/distributors/index.html" class="external-link">other EU distributors</a>. I contacted one in the Netherlands, named <em>Bio-Connect</em>, for 25g of <em>FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals</em>; if they ask a high price I can always show them the price of Cambridge Bioscience. I also emailed <em>instruchemie</em>.   </p>
<h4 id="instruchemie-distributor"><em>Instruchemie</em> distributor</h4>
<p><em>Instruchemie</em> asks me if I buy for a company.  <br />
ChatGPT says: "I need to buy via a scientific research company for legal reasons. I can create a <em>Sole Proprietorship</em> in Belgium easily to resolve this issue. Later you can convert to a <em>Private Limited Company</em> for protection from personal liability and to scale the company's personnel.".  <br />
I answered <em>Instruchemie</em> that I was ready to create a company in Belgium for the purchase but would like to know beforehand if they could supply the Tipepidine at a reasonable price. I used my past research to show that I am a legitimate researcher. Email:```   </p>

<p>They answered fast without rejecting me, saying that they already contacted the supplier <em>FujiFilm</em> to inform me shortly. <br />
Later I they informed me that 25g of tipepidine would cost €155. Additional transport costs are not known. For orders below €500, a small order fee of €40 is applicable. Shipment in refrigerated conditions costs an additional €30, and on dry ice €50. The delivery time is approximately 4 weeks.  <br />
<em>Sopachem</em> has a better deal.   </p>
<h4 id="sopachem-distributor"><em>Sopachem</em> distributor</h4>
<p><em>Sopachem</em> would be ideal as it is a Belgian supplier of <em>FujiFilm</em>. <br />
As previously said, I contacted both <em>FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals</em> and <em>Sopachem</em>. <em>Sopachem</em> wasn't answering me, even if they in the end did after a week. <em>FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals</em> answered fast and referred me to their Belgian distributor <em>Sopachem</em>, but when I told them <em>Sopachem</em> was not answering they contacted <em>Sopachem</em> on my behalf and I received a fast answer from someone at <em>Sopachem</em>. <br />
Bart Vleugens, with this email address (bart.vleugels@sopachem.com), answered me on behalf of <em>Sopachem</em>. He says the Tipepidine I want from <em>FujiFilm</em> is available for purchase and shipping via <em>Sopachem</em>. The purchase price is €92 (VAT exclusive). They have a fixed fee for <em>FujiFilm</em> orders of €39 EUR (VAT exclusive) and maintain a small order fee of €35 for orders below €300 (VAT exclusive). This means 25g tipepidine would end up at €166 (VAT exclusive). This is a great price and equals €24/month for 120mg tipepidine a day.  <br />
Finally, <em>Sopachem</em> asked me my institution/company for shipping and invoicing. I will try to incorporate <a href="#company" class="anchor-link">Company</a>. <br />
Quickly afterwards, they already contacted <em>FujiFilm</em>, and informed me that the estimated delivery time will be 5-6 weeks as it has to come from Japan. This is understandable and not a problem if I buy in bulk either way.   </p>
<p>I can ask them information about the product's quality. I can ask them: for a recent Certificate of Analysis (CoA); if they have stability data and recommended shelf life; if they have a GMP certificate. I suspect they don't have a GMP certificate and I would accept that, but it is good to know their response either way. <br />
I answered/asked them the following:    </p>

<h4 id="learn-more-about-research-vs-gmp-grade">Learn more about research vs GMP grade</h4>
<p>Research-grade tipepidine is only meant for non-clinical, non-human applications. Permitted scenarios are: usage in cell cultures; usage in pre-clinical animal studies; usage for pharmacological exploration. It is not allowed for human consumption or clinical trials. GMP certification is necessary for human consumption or clinical trials.   </p>
<p>Human research is tightly regulated to protect subjects and ensure data validity. Using research-grade <em>active pharmaceutical ingredients</em> (APIs) in humans is forbidden because: they may contain contaminants, residual solvents, by-products, or even misidentified compounds; two batches may vary in purity, stability, or potency, which is unacceptable for dosing in humans; research chemicals lack validated shelf-life and storage conditions while a degraded compound could form toxic byproducts.   </p>
<p>Research-grade material is acceptable for in-vitro studies and exploratory animal work. If promising, the compound is “tech-transferred” to a GMP manufacturer. A specialized contract manufacturing organization (CMO) produces the same molecule but under GMP conditions. To test in humans, investigators file a dossier. This includes proof that the API is GMP-grade, plus preclinical safety and pharmacology data. Once regulators and ethics committees approve, the GMP API is used to make clinical trial formulations (capsules, syrups, injectables) in a licensed facility. Every dose given to a human must come from that controlled, documented GMP batch.   </p>
