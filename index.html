      <h1 id="workouts">Workouts</h1>
<p>Workout A:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Sumo Deadlift / Zercher Squat, 3 series, 5-15 reps    <ul>
<li>(strengthen legs, lower back, grip, grow traps)    </li>
<li>(Sumo deadlift works the most amount of muscles while focusing more on quadriceps compared to conventional deadlift, it also resembles most the leg stance used when lifting opponent at Judo.)   </li>
<li>(Zercher Squat ressembles more opponent lifting at Judo, due to the weight being in arms and in front of the body, it works the core more. Use a bar pad if necessary.)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leg curls machine + hip adduction machine + hip abductor machine + <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/baEXLy09Ncc" class="external-link">calf raises</a> on leg press, 3 series, 8-20 reps    <ul>
<li>(isolate remaining leg muscles)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dumbbell-incline-bench-press/bar-decline-bench-press + rows/(weighted pull ups/lat pull down), 3 series, 6-15 reps    <ul>
<li>(develop chest and back from different angles, switch exercises every other session)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cable-lateral-raises/upright-row + cable-rear-deltoid-fly/face-pulls, 3 series, 10-15 reps    <ul>
<li>(isolate lateral and rear deltoid, the front deltoid is already engaged enough via chest exercises)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curls + seated dip machine, 3 series, 10-15reps    <ul>
<li>(isolate biceps who are a weak point of mine)   </li>
<li>(strengthen triceps together with chest again and front deltoids as chest is a weak point and front deltoids are not much engaged)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Workout B:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Weighted leg raises with alternating oblique raise, 3 series, 8-14 reps    <ul>
<li>(strengthen abs and obliques while emphasizing the difficult to develop lower abs,    </li>
<li>(also strengthen psoas muscle for lifting with legs in judo, usually it is not a good idea to strengthen this muscle but if antagonistic muscles glutes are also strong there is no problem)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oblique twists with cable or elastics, 3 series, 8-14 reps OR Windshield wiper while hanging from a bar, 3 series, 20 reps OR <a href="https://youtu.be/Ae0f-fiJ5SU?t=42" class="external-link">barbell landmine setup twists while standing</a> 3 sets, 10-20 reps   <ul>
<li>(strengthen abs and obliques while working movement similar to moving someone to the side in judo)   </li>
<li>(For explosiveness in judo the barbell landmine exercise is probably best)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>+-45° side neck curls on each side + rear head together with back of hand on bench with arms having 90° angle and perform head extensions while also pushing back hand on bench to help up and down movement    <ul>
<li>(strengthen neck and the rotator cuff who usually is weak on second exercise)   </li>
<li>(The first exercise works both neck sides, it can also be replaced or drop set by regular straight neck curls)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optionally also work explosiveness and interval cardio for judo:   <ul>
<li>airbike at full intensity for 15 seconds followed by low intensity for 45 seconds, 3 series    <ul>
<li>(no pause between sets)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explosive face pulls, 3 series, 5 reps   </li>
<li>Explosive jumps OR trap bar deadlifts with jump, 3 series, 5 reps   </li>
<li>The previously mentioned 'barbell landmine setup twists while standing' can also be done explosively   </li>
<li>Explosive push-ups and inverted rows   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Workout C:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Calisthenics... See below what and how to train...   </li>
</ul>
<p>Minimal performance goals: <br />
100kg deadlift 3X10 (10/05/2024 - 120kg for 7reps) <br />
80kg squat 3X10 <br />
60kg decline bench 3X10 <br />
24kg incline bench dumb bells 3X10 <br />
60kg rows/lat-pull-down/pull-up 3X10 <br />
Holding the front-lever,  <br />
Holding the back-lever, <br />
6 muscle-ups, <br />
Holding human flag   </p>
<p>Context: <br />
Workout A is a full body workout that should be performed at least once a week. If performed more than once, maybe switch deadlift/squat with leg extension on second and/or third time doing the workout in same week to avoid excess stress on spine. <br />
Workout B is a short workout preferably done at home to gain time and avoid looking weird in gym while performing neck exercises. Neck exercises are desirable in combat sports as they can prevent dangerous injuries, brain damage, but also be of general use in some positions. Also developing neck can improve physical appearance in a men (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">1</a>). <br />
A sauna after physical exercise can help hypertrophy. In theory it could counteract the negative effect antihistamines have on hypertrophy. Thus a sauna is best done following the big hypertrophy workout A. On the other hand cold exposure lowers hypertrophy but speeds recovery. <br />
Even if I perform workout A and B only once a week I can still see progression and muscle gain, however this muscle gain may be related to muscle memory, thus getting back muscle who was previously lost which is easier.   </p>
<p>It is also important to stretch from time to time. I usually stretch in the spa after my workout. But also randomly in the day at times.   </p>
<p>For judo and in general it can be interesting to sometimes use higher weight for lower reps. Thus train strength more and hypertrophy less. Strength training will aid explosiveness in judo but also aid hypertrophy indirectly by allowing lifting more weight. Explosiveness can also be trained directly which is a form of strength training too but focusing on faster movements with less weight. Being explosive is useful at the judo. When training for explosiveness do low amount of reps but as fast as possible with a weight that is heavy but still you can move fast. Strength training works less the muscle fibers but more the nervous system which demands longer recovery times between sets and workouts. Cardio with periodic high or low intensity can also be useful for the judo.   </p>
<p>At the end of my judo lessons I have the opportunity to do some calisthenics as I like... This is workout C.   </p>

<h2 id="pictures">Pictures</h2>
<p>As recommended by professional social media influencer. For the best pictures it is recommended to lower luminosity. In theory, one way that lowering luminosity could help is by making skin appear darker which is considered a masculine trait (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">aesthetic, attractiveness, carotenoid, color, diet, dominance, fruit, oxidative-stress, physical-exercise, physical-look, skin, sunlight, tadalafil, vegetables</a>). Second advice is to put camera focus on muscle. <br />
As explained here (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">aesthetic, attractiveness, beard, cheekbones, dentistry, eyebrow, eyes, hair, height, jaw, lips, nose, personal-health, personal-project, physical-look, skin, symmetry, tips, voice</a>), in general taking good pictures is not easy. Using the proper camera distance for example can prevent image distortions. Else the flash light may not always be desirable.   </p>

I probably gained upper body muscle but maybe lost some quadriceps muscle from not squatting anymore, only sumo deadlifting. From the body-scan app I gained a little muscle in legs. <br />
It is interesting to point out I maybe gained muscle after cessation of cholesterol medication (bezafibrate) (<a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">personal-experience, physical-exercise</a>). I only trained full-body once a week while doing judo twice a week. And I was using bilastine (antihistamine) and amisulpride (hyperprolactinemia) which both could in theory lower muscle mass but didn't seem to. It may also be important to point out that my muscles got created in the past and I maybe used muscle-memory to gain it back even in suboptimal conditions.   </p>

<ul>
<li>First be able to do 10 muscle ups, 20 dips and 20 burpees.   </li>
<li>First we need to learn how to superman on the bar which looks <a href="https://youtu.be/_fKmUPU9qTY?t=111" class="external-link">like this</a>.   </li>
<li>Then you also need <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fKmUPU9qTY" class="external-link">to tuck</a>.   </li>
<li>Next you need to do previous superman with tuck but <a href="https://youtu.be/_fKmUPU9qTY?t=387" class="external-link">with jump</a> where hands let go of the bar straight above it which we call to pop.   </li>
<li>Next we need to start jumping on the bar, first by just tapping our foot on the bar.   </li>
<li>Then we can start jumping on bar with two feet. When doing this we want to jump forward towards the bar.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Train for <strong>Muscle up 360</strong>:   </p>
<ul>
<li>You should first be able to perform at least 10 explosive muscle ups with bar pop as explained in 'muscle up with jump on the bar' section.   </li>
<li>Then a first exercise is to do a 360 after jumping by <a href="https://youtu.be/x9Twx3Mgj84?t=96" class="external-link">using arms to steer body around</a>.   </li>
<li>Then you can combine the turn while doing bar pop, first 180, then 270, and finally 360.   </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="todo">TODO</h1>
<p>Divide the page in <em>strength and aesthetic training</em> and <em>calisthenics</em>.   </p>
<p>Try to do the one arm pull-up and planche.   </p>
<p>Document new calisthenics' workouts (see certain training programs on DL app).   </p>
<p>Record (picture/video) all calisthenics' performances. Collect them in this note to display.   </p>
<p>Write down Alex as the coach, who also performs kinesiologist work, with his contact information. He is a great coach and thus it is interesting to remember him and his contact details when necessary. <br />
Maybe also write in judo note that I do judo at <em>la chenaie</em> which is a great club.</p></div>
